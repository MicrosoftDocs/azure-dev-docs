# Azure tools for Java developers

## Supported JDK runtimes

Java developers on Azure and Azure Stack can build and run production Java 7,8, and 11 applications using [Azul Systems Zulu Enterprise builds of OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) without incurring additional support costs. If you’re currently running Java apps with other JDKs, consider migrating to Zulu on Azure for free support and maintenance. 

For more information about the supported JDKs available for use when developing on Azure, see <https://aka.ms/azure-jdks>.

## Eclipse and IntelliJ plugins

Manage Azure resources and deploy apps from your IDE with The Azure toolkits for [Eclipse](eclipse/azure-toolkit-for-eclipse.md) and [IntelliJ](intellij/azure-toolkit-for-intellij.md).

## Visual Studio Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight but powerful code editor available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. VS Code supports a simple, modern Java development workflow through a set of extensions that provide project support, code completion, debugging, linting, and navigation.

## Azure CLI 2.0

The Azure 2.0 CLI provides a command-line experience to manage Azure resources. You can use it in your browser with [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview), or you can [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) it on macOS, Linux, and Windows and run it from the command line.
