#Customer intent: As a Java and Spring developer, I want to deploy apps to Azure as JAR files so that I don't have to deal with app server configuration and management.

# Deploy a Spring Boot JAR file app to Azure App Service with Maven and Azure on Linux

In this quickstart, you'll use the [Maven Plugin for Azure App Service Web Apps](/java/api/overview/azure/maven/azure-webapp-maven-plugin/readme) to deploy a Spring Boot application packaged as a Java SE JAR to [Azure App Service on Linux](/azure/app-service/containers/). You'll want to choose Java SE deployment over [Tomcat and WAR files](/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-java) when you want to consolidate your app's dependencies, runtime, and configuration into a single deployable artifact.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you'll need to have the following installed and configured:

* The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/), either locally or through [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).
* A supported Java Development Kit (JDK). For more information about the JDKs available for use when developing on Azure, see <https://aka.ms/azure-jdks>.
* Apache's [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), Version 3).
* A [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) client.

## Install and sign in to Azure CLI

The simplest and easiest way to get the Maven Plugin deploying your Spring Boot application is by using [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/).

Sign into your Azure account by using the Azure CLI:
   
   ```shell
   az login
   ```
   
Follow the instructions to complete the sign-in process.

## Clone the sample app

In this section, you will clone a completed Spring Boot application and test it locally.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window and create a local directory to hold your Spring Boot application, and change to that directory; for example:
   ```shell
   md C:\SpringBoot
   cd C:\SpringBoot
   ```
   -- or --
   ```shell
   mkdir ~/SpringBoot
   cd ~/SpringBoot
   ```

1. Clone the [Spring Boot Getting Started] sample project into the directory you created; for example:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot
   ```

1. Change directory to the completed project; for example:
   ```shell
   cd gs-spring-boot/complete
   ```

1. Build the JAR file using Maven; for example:
   ```shell
   mvn clean package
   ```

1. When the web app has been created, start the web app using Maven; for example:
   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

1. Test the web app by browsing to it locally using a web browser. For example, you could use the following command if you have curl available:
   ```shell
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

1. You should see the following message displayed: **Greetings from Spring Boot!**

## Configure Maven Plugin for Azure App Service

In this section, you will configure the Spring Boot project `pom.xml` so that Maven can deploy the app to Azure App Service on Linux.

1. Open `pom.xml` in a code editor.

2. In the `<build>` section of the pom.xml, add the following `<plugin>` entry inside the `<plugins>` tag.

   ```xml
   <plugin>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.8.0</version>
   </plugin>
   ```

3. Then you can configure the deployment, run the following maven command in the Command Prompt and use the **number** to choose these options in the prompt:
    * **OS**: linux  
    * **javaVersion**: Java 8    
    
```cmd
mvn azure-webapp:config
```

When you get the **Confirm (Y/N)** prompt, press **'y'** and the configuration is done.

```cmd
~@Azure:~/gs-spring-boot/complete$ mvn azure-webapp:config
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO]

[WARNING] The plugin may not work if you change the os of an existing webapp.

```

4. Add the `<appSettings>` section to the `<configuration>` section of `<azure-webapp-maven-plugin>` to listen on the *80* port.

    ```xml
   <plugin>
       <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
       <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
       <version>1.8.0</version>
       <configuration>
          <schemaVersion>V2</schemaVersion>
          <resourceGroup>gs-spring-boot-1559091271202-rg</resourceGroup>
          <appName>gs-spring-boot-1559091271202</appName>
          <region>westeurope</region>
          <pricingTier>P1V2</pricingTier>
          <runtime>
            <os>linux</os>
            <javaVersion>jre8</javaVersion>
            <webContainer>jre8</webContainer>
          </runtime>
          <!-- Begin of App Settings  -->
          <appSettings>
             <property>
                   <name>JAVA_OPTS</name>
                   <value>-Dserver.port=80</value>
             </property>
          </appSettings>
          <!-- End of App Settings  -->
          <deployment>
            <resources>
              <resource>
                <directory>${project.basedir}/target</directory>
                <includes>
                  <include>*.jar</include>
                </includes>
              </resource>
            </resources>
          </deployment>
         </configuration>
   </plugin>
   ```

## Deploy the app to Azure

Once you have configured all of the settings in the preceding sections of this article, you are ready to deploy your web app to Azure. To do so, use the following steps:

1. From the command prompt or terminal window that you were using earlier, rebuild the JAR file using Maven if you made any changes to the *pom.xml* file; for example:
   ```shell
   mvn clean package
   ```

1. Deploy your web app to Azure by using Maven; for example:
   ```shell
   mvn azure-webapp:deploy
   ```

Maven will deploy your web app to Azure; if the web app or web app plan does not already exist, it will be created for you.

When your web has been deployed, you will be able to manage it through the [Azure portal].

* Your web app will be listed in **App Services**:

   ![Web app listed in Azure portal App Services][AP01]

* And the URL for your web app will be listed in the **Overview** for your web app:

   ![Find the URL for your web app in Azure portal App Services][AP02]

Verify that the deployment was successful by using the same cURL command as before, using your web app URL from the Portal instead of `localhost`. You should see the following message displayed: **Greetings from Spring Boot!** 

## Clean up resources
When the Azure resources are no longer needed, clean up the resources you deployed by deleting the resource group.

- From the Azure portal, select Resource group from the left menu.
- Enter **gs-spring-boot-** in the **Filter by name** field, the resource group created in this tutorial should have this prefix.
- Select the resource group created in this tutorial.
- Select Delete resource group from the top menu.
