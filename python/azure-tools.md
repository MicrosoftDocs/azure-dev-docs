# Azure tools for Python developers

## Visual Studio Code

Python is fully supported in Visual Studio Code through the highly popular Python extension.

[Install Visual Studio Code and the Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

## Azure SDK for Python

The Azure SDK for Python provides an API through which you can interact with Azure from Python code.

[Install Azure SDK for Python libraries](azure-sdk-install.md)

## Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The cross-platform Azure CLI provides a command-line interface to create and configure Azure resources in your subscriptions. The Azure CLI includes query and filtering features so you can pipe output directly to other command-line tools. (The Azure CLI itself is written in Python and uses the Azure SDK for Python.)

[Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Azure PowerShell

Like the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell provides PowerShell commands to create and configure Azure resources and can be used with the full suite of general PowerShell capabilities.

[Install Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)

## Visual Studio

Visual Studio on Windows provides open-source support for the Python language through the Python Development and Data Science workloads (Visual Studio 2017 and later) and the free Python Tools for Visual Studio extension (Visual Studio 2015 and earlier). Visual Studio is most commonly used by developers working with both Python and C++, as it offers best-in-class cross-language development and debugging support.
