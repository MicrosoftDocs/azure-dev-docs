# Use GitHub Actions to connect to Azure

Learn how to use [Azure login](https://github.com/Azure/login) with either [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/PowerShell) or [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/CLI) to interact with your Azure resources.

To use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI in a GitHub Actions workflow, you need to first log in with the [Azure login](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login) action.
The Azure login action allows you to execute commands in a workflow in the context of an [Azure AD service principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object).

Once you have set up the login action, you can then use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

By default, the action logs in with the Azure CLI, setting up the GitHub action runner environment for Azure CLI. You can use Azure PowerShell with `enable-AzPSSession` property of the Azure login action. This sets up the GitHub action runner environment with the Azure PowerShell module.

## Create a service principal and add it to GitHub secret

To use [Azure login](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login), you first need to add your Azure service principal as a secret to your GitHub repository.

In this example, you will create a secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` that you can use to authenticate with Azure.  

1. If you do not have an existing application, register a [new Active Directory application](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal&preserve-view=true) to use with your service principal.

    ```azurecli-interactive
        appName="myApp"

        az ad app create \
        --display-name $appName \
        --homepage "http://localhost/$appName" \
        --identifier-uris http://localhost/$appName
    ```

1. [Create a new service principal](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) in the Azure portal for your app. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
        az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                                    --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} \
                                    --sdk-auth
    ```

1. Copy the JSON object for your service principal.

    ```json
    {
        "clientId": "<GUID>",
        "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
        "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
        "tenantId": "<GUID>",
        (...)
    }
    ```

1. Open your GitHub repository and go to **Settings**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/github-repo-settings.png" alt-text="Select Settings in the navigation":::

1. Select **Secrets** and then **New Secret**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/select-secrets.png" alt-text="Choose to add a secret":::

1. Paste in your JSON object for your service principal with the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-secret-add.png" alt-text="Add a secret in GitHub":::

1. Save by selecting **Add secret**.

## Use the Azure login action

Use the service principal secret with the [Azure Login action](https://github.com/Azure/login) to authenticate to Azure.

In this workflow, you authenticate using the Azure login action with the service principal details stored in `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. Then, you run an Azure CLI action. For more information about referencing GitHub secrets in a workflow file, see [Using encrypted secrets in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow) in GitHub Docs.

Once you have a working Azure login step, you can use the [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/PowerShell) or [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/CLI) actions. You can also use other Azure actions, like [Azure webapp deploy](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy) and [Azure functions](https://github.com/Azure/functions-action).

```yaml
on: [push]

name: AzureLoginSample

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Log in with Azure
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}'
```

## Use the Azure PowerShell action

In this example, you log in with the [Azure Login action](https://github.com/Azure/login) and then retrieve a resource group with the [Azure PowerShell action](https://github.com/azure/powershell).

```yaml
on: [push]

name: AzureLoginSample

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Log in with Azure
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: '${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}'
          enable-AzPSSession: true
      - name: Azure PowerShell Action
        uses: Azure/powershell@v1
        with:
          inlineScript: Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "< YOUR RESOURCE GROUP >"
          azPSVersion: 3.1.0
```

## Use the Azure CLI action

In this example, you log in with the [Azure Login action](https://github.com/Azure/login) and then retrieve a resource group with the [Azure CLI action](https://github.com/Azure/CLI).


```yaml
on: [push]

name: AzureLoginSample

jobs:
build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Log in with Azure
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

    - name: Azure CLI script
        uses: azure/CLI@v1
        with:
        azcliversion: 2.0.72
        inlineScript: |
            az account show
            az storage -h
```
