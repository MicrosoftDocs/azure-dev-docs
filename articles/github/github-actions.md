# Deploy to Azure using GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-actions) enable developers to build automated software development lifecycle workflows.  

With GitHub Actions for Azure you can create workflows that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release and **deploy** to Azure. [Learn more about all other integrations with Azure](https://aka.ms/GitHubonAzure).

Get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source)!
