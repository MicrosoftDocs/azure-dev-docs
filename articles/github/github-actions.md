# Deploy to Azure using GitHub Actions

You use GitHub Actions for Azure to automate your workflows to deploy to Azure. To get started, see these three GitHub Actions: 

- [Azure/webapps-deploy action](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy), to deploy to Azure Web Apps and Azure Web App for Containers 
- [Azure/appservice-settings](https://github.com/Azure/appservice-settings) to configure App settings, connection strings and other general settings in bulk using JSON syntax on your Azure WebApp (Windows or Linux) or any of its deployment slots.

## Key concepts

GitHub Actions enable you to create custom software development life cycle (SDLC) workflows directly in your GitHub repository. For an overview of GitHub Actions and core concepts, review the following articles: 

- [About GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions)
