# Tutorial: Configure apps in Azure App Service using Ansible

[!INCLUDE [ansible-27-note.md](includes/ansible-27-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-intro-app-service.md](../includes/open-source-devops-intro-app-service.md)]

In this article, you learn how to:

>
> * Create an app in Azure App Service with Java 8 and the Tomcat container runtime
> * Create an Azure Traffic Manager profile
> * Define a Traffic Manager endpoint using the created app

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]
[!INCLUDE [ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md](includes/ansible-prereqs-cloudshell-use-or-vm-creation2.md)]

## Create a basic app service

The playbook code in this section defines the following resources:

* Azure resource group within which the App Service plan and app are deployed
* App service on Linux with Java 8 and the Tomcat container runtime

Save the following playbook as `firstwebapp.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
    webapp_name: myfirstWebApp
    plan_name: myAppServicePlan
    location: eastus
  tasks:
    - name: Create a resource group
      azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: "{{ resource_group }}"
        location: "{{ location }}"

    - name: Create App Service on Linux with Java Runtime
      azure_rm_webapp:
        resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
        name: "{{ webapp_name }}"
        plan:
          resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
          name: "{{ plan_name }}"
          is_linux: true
          sku: S1
          number_of_workers: 1
        frameworks:
          - name: "java"
            version: "8"
            settings:
              java_container: tomcat
              java_container_version: 8.5
```

Run the playbook using [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)

```bash
ansible-playbook firstwebapp.yml
```

After running the playbook, you see output similar to the following results:

```Output
PLAY [localhost] 

TASK [Gathering Facts] 
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create a resource group] 
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Create App Service on Linux with Java Runtime] 
 [WARNING]: Azure API profile latest does not define an entry for WebSiteManagementClient

changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP 
localhost                  : ok=3    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

## Create an app and use Azure Traffic Manager

[Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/app-service/web-sites-traffic-manager) enables you to control how requests from web clients are distributed to apps in Azure App Service. When App Service endpoints are added to an Azure Traffic Manager profile, Traffic Manager tracks the status of your App Service apps. Statuses include running, stopped, and deleted. Traffic Manager is used to decide which endpoints should receive the traffic.

In App Service, an app runs in an [App Service plan](/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans). An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for an app to run. You can manage your App Service plan and web app in different groups.

The playbook code in this section defines the following resources:

* Azure resource group within which the App Service plan is deployed
* App Service plan
* Azure resource group within which the app is deployed
* App service on Linux with Java 8 and the Tomcat container runtime
* Traffic Manager profile
* Traffic Manager endpoint using the created app

Save the following playbook as `webapp.yml`:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    resource_group_webapp: myResourceGroupWebapp
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
    webapp_name: myLinuxWebApp
    plan_name: myAppServicePlan
    location: eastus
    traffic_manager_profile_name: myTrafficManagerProfile
    traffic_manager_endpoint_name: myTrafficManagerEndpoint

  tasks:
  - name: Create resource group
    azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: "{{ resource_group_webapp }}"
        location: "{{ location }}"

  - name: Create secondary resource group
    azure_rm_resourcegroup:
        name: "{{ resource_group }}"
        location: "{{ location }}"

  - name: Create App Service Plan
    azure_rm_appserviceplan:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
      name: "{{ plan_name }}"
      location: "{{ location }}"
      is_linux: true
      sku: S1
      number_of_workers: 1

  - name: Create App Service on Linux with Java Runtime
    azure_rm_webapp:
        resource_group: "{{ resource_group_webapp }}"
        name: "{{ webapp_name }}"
        plan:
          resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
          name: "{{ plan_name }}"
          is_linux: true
          sku: S1
          number_of_workers: 1
        app_settings:
          testkey: "testvalue"
        frameworks:
          - name: java
            version: 8
            settings:
              java_container: "Tomcat"
              java_container_version: "8.5"

  - name: Get web app facts
    azure_rm_webapp_facts:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group_webapp }}"
      name: "{{ webapp_name }}"
    register: webapp
    
  - name: Create Traffic Manager Profile
    azure_rm_trafficmanagerprofile:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group_webapp }}"
      name: "{{ traffic_manager_profile_name }}"
      location: global
      routing_method: performance
      dns_config:
        relative_name: "{{ traffic_manager_profile_name }}"
        ttl:  60
      monitor_config:
        protocol: HTTPS
        port: 80
        path: '/'

  - name: Add endpoint to traffic manager profile, using created web site
    azure_rm_trafficmanagerendpoint:
      resource_group: "{{ resource_group_webapp }}"
      profile_name: "{{ traffic_manager_profile_name }}"
      name: "{{ traffic_manager_endpoint_name }}"
      type: azure_endpoints
      location: "{{ location }}"
      target_resource_id: "{{ webapp.webapps[0].id }}"
```

Run the playbook using [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)

```bash
ansible-playbook webapp.yml
```

After running the playbook, you see output similar to the following results:

```Output
PLAY [localhost] 

TASK [Gathering Facts] 
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create resource group] 
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Create resource group for app service plan]
