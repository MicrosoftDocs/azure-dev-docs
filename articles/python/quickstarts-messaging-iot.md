# Messaging, Events, and IoT for Python apps on Azure

The following articles help you get started with messaging, event ingestion and processing, and Internet of Things (IoT) services in Azure.

## Messaging

Azure messaging services let different components and apps communicate easily, no matter what language they use or where they're hostedâ€”whether in the same cloud, across multiple clouds, or on-premises.

## Events

Azure Event Hubs and Azure Event Grid are two key services for handling events in Azure. They provide capabilities for ingesting, processing, and routing events across various applications and services.

These services allow you to build event-driven architectures and process events in real time.

  - [Azure Event Grid Client Library Python Samples](/samples/azure/azure-sdk-for-python/eventgrid-samples/)

## Internet of Things (IoT)

Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a set of managed and platform services across edge and cloud that connect, monitor, and control IoT assets. IoT also encompasses device security, operating systems, and data analytics tools to help you build, deploy, and manage IoT applications effectively.

- **IoT Hub**
