# Data solutions for Python apps on Azure

Azure offers a choice of fully managed relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases, spanning proprietary and open-source engines in addition to storage services for object, block, and file storage. The following articles help you get started with Python data solutions on Azure.

## Databases

- **PostgreSQL**: Build scalable, secure, and fully managed enterprise-ready apps on open-source PostgreSQL, scale out single-node PostgreSQL with high performance, or migrate PostgreSQL and Oracle workloads to the cloud.
