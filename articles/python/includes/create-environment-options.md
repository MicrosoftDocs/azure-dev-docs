* Configure a Python virtual environment using `venv` or your tool of choice. You can create the virtual environment locally or in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) and run the code there. Be sure to activate the virtual environment to start using it.

* Use a [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

* Use a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) in [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview).
