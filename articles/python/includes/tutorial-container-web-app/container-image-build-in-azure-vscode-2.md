Select **F1** or **CTRL+SHIFT+P** to open the command palette.

* Type "registries".

* Select the task **Azure Container Registry: Build Image in Azure...**

If you don't see the task, check that **Azure** appears under **REGISTRIES** in the Docker extension. You can also right-click the *Dockerfile* and select **Build Image in Azure...** to run the task.
