# Part 7: Main application API endpoint

[Previous part: Main app startup code](walkthrough-tutorial-authentication-06.md)

The app's */api/v1/getcode* API generates a JSON response that contains an alphanumerical code and a timestamp.

First, the `@app.route` decorator tells Flask that the `get_code` function handles requests to the */api/v1/getcode* URL.

```python
@app.route('/api/v1/getcode', methods=['GET'])
def get_code():
```

Next, we call the third-party API, the URL of which is in `number_url`, providing the access key that we retrieve from the key vault in the header.

```python
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'x-functions-key': access_key
        }

    r = requests.get(url = number_url, headers = headers)

    if (r.status_code != 200):
        return "Could not get you a code.", r.status_code
```

The `x-functions-key` property in the header is specifically how Azure Functions (where this example third-party API is deployed) expects an access key to appear in a header. For more information, see [Azure Functions HTTP trigger - Authorization keys](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=csharp#authorization-keys). If calling the API fails for any reason, we return an error message and the status code.

Assuming that the API call succeeds and returns a numerical value, we then construct a more complex code using that number plus some random characters (using our own `random_char` function).

```python
    data = r.json()
    chars1 = random_char(3)
    chars2 = random_char(3)
    code_value = f"{chars1}-{data['value']}-{chars2}"
    code = { "code": code_value, "timestamp" : str(datetime.utcnow()) }
```

The `code` variable here contains the full JSON response for the app's API, which includes the code value as well as a timestamp. An example response would be `{"code":"ojE-161-pTv","timestamp":"2020-04-15 16:54:48.816549"}`.

Before returning that response, however, we write a message with it in our storage queue using the Queue client's [`send_message`](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueclient?view=azure-python#send-message-content----kwargs-) method:

```python
    queue_client.send_message(code)

    return jsonify(code)
```

## Processing queue messages

Messages stored in the queue can be viewed and managed through the [Azure portal](/azure/storage/queues/storage-quickstart-queues-portal#view-message-properties) or with the Azure CLI command [`az storage message get`](/cli/azure/storage/message?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-message-get). The sample repository includes a script (*test.cmd* and *test.sh*) to request a code from the app endpoint and then check the message queue. There's also a script to clear the queue using the [`az storage message clear`](/cli/azure/storage/message?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-message-clear) command.

Typically, an app like this example would have another process that asynchronously pulls messages from the queue for further processing. As mentioned earlier, the response generated by this API endpoint might be used elsewhere in the app with two-factor user authentication. In that case, the app should to invalidate the code after a certain period of time, say 10 minutes. A simple way to do this task would be to maintain a table of valid two-factor authentication codes, which are used by its user login procedure. The app would then have a simple queue-watching process with the following logic (in pseudo-code):

<pre>
pull a message from the queue and retrieve the code.

if (code is already in the table):
    remove the code from the table, thereby invalidating it
else:
    add the code to the table, making it valid
    call queue_client.send_message(code, visibility_timeout=600)
</pre>

This pseudo-code employs the [`send_message`](/python/api/azure-storage-queue/azure.storage.queue.queueclient?view=azure-python#send-message-content----kwargs-) method's optional `visibility_timeout` parameter, which specifies the number of seconds before the message becomes visible in the queue. Because the default timeout is zero, messages initially written by the API endpoint become immediately visible to the queue-watching process. As a result, that process stores them in the valid code table right away. By queuing the same message again with the timeout, the process knows that it will receive the code again 10 minutes later, at which point it removes it from the table.

## Implementing the main app API endpoint in Azure Functions

The code shown previously in this article uses the Flask web framework to create its API endpoint. Because Flask needs to run with a web server, such code must be deployed to Azure App Service or to a virtual machine.

An alternate deployment option is the serverless environment of Azure Functions. In this case, all the startup code and the API endpoint code would be contained within the same function that's bound to an HTTP trigger. As with App Service, you use [function application settings](/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) to create environment variables for your code.

One piece of the implementation that becomes easier is authenticating with Queue Storage. Instead of obtaining a `QueueClient` object using the queue's URL and a credential object, you create a *queue storage binding* for the function. The binding handles all the authentication behind the scenes. With such a binding, your function is given a ready-to-use client object as a parameter. For more information and example code, see [Connect Azure Functions to Azure Queue Storage](/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-cli?tabs=bash%2Cbrowser&pivots=programming-language-python).
