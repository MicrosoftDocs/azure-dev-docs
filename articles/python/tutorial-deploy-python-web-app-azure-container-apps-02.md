# Tutorial: Build and deploy a Python web app with Azure Container Apps and PostgreSQL

This article is part of a tutorial series about how to containerize and deploy a Python web app to [Azure Container Apps][8]. Container Apps enables you to deploy containerized apps without managing complex infrastructure.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Containerize a Python sample web app (Django or Flask) by building a container image in the cloud.
> * Deploy the container image to Azure Container Apps.
> * Define environment variables that enable the container app to connect to an [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server][10] instance, where the sample app stores data.

The following diagram highlights the tasks in this tutorial: building and deploying a container image.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can run Azure CLI commands in [Azure Cloud Shell][4] or on a workstation with the [Azure CLI][7] installed.

If you're running locally, follow these steps to sign in and install the necessary modules for this tutorial:

1. Sign in to Azure and authenticate, if necessary:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Make sure you're running the latest version of the Azure CLI:

    ```azurecli
    az upgrade
    ```

1. Install or upgrade the *containerapp* and *rdbms-connect* Azure CLI extensions by using the [az extension add][14] command:

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade
    az extension add --name rdbms-connect --upgrade
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > To list the extensions installed on your system, you can use the [az extension list](/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-list) command. For example:
    >
    > ```azurecli
    > az extension list --query [].name --output tsv
    > ```

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

Make sure the following extensions are installed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

* [Docker extension][6]
* [Azure Databases extension][26]
* [Azure Container Apps extension][11]

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Sign in to the [Azure portal][3].

---

## Get the sample app

Fork and clone the sample code to your developer environment:

1. Go to the GitHub repository of the sample app ([Django][1] or [Flask][2]) and select **Fork**.

    Follow the steps to fork the repo to your GitHub account. You can also download the code repo directly to your local machine without forking or a GitHub account. But if you use the download method, you won't be able to set up continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in the next tutorial in this series.

1. At the command prompt in your console, use the [git clone][21] command to clone the forked repo into the *python-container* folder:

    ```console
    # Django
    git clone https://github.com/<github-username>/msdocs-python-django-azure-container-apps.git python-container
    
    # Flask
    # git clone https://github.com/<github-username>/msdocs-python-flask-azure-container-apps.git python-container
    ```

1. Change the directory:

    ```console
    cd python-container
    ```

## Build a container image from web app code

After you follow these steps, you'll have an Azure Container Registry instance that contains a Docker container image built from the sample code.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. If you're running commands in a Git Bash shell on a Windows computer, enter the following command before proceeding:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
    ```

1. Create a resource group by using the [az group create][17] command:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=<resource-group-name>
    LOCATION=<location>
    az group create \
        --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
        --location $LOCATION
    ```

1. Create a container registry by using the [az acr create][18] command:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    REGISTRY_NAME=<registry-name> #The name that you use for *\<registry-name>* must be unique within Azure, and it must contain 5 to 50 alphanumeric characters.
    az acr create \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
        --name $REGISTRY_NAME \
        --sku Basic \
        --admin-enabled true
    ```

1. Sign in to the registry by using the [az acr login][19] command:

    ```azurecli
    az acr login --name $REGISTRY_NAME
    ```

    The command adds "azurecr.io" to the name to create the fully qualified registry name. If the sign-in is successful, the message "Login Succeeded" appears. If you're accessing the registry from a subscription that's different from the one in which you created the registry, use the `--suffix` switch.

    If sign-in fails, make sure the Docker daemon is running on your system.

1. Build the image by using the [az acr build][5] command:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    az acr build \
        --registry $REGISTRY_NAME \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
        --image pythoncontainer:latest .
    ```

    These considerations apply:

    * The dot (`.`) at the end of the command indicates the location of the source code to build. If you aren't running this command in the sample app's root directory, specify the path to the code.

    * If you're running the command in Azure Cloud Shell, use `git clone` to first pull the repo into the Cloud Shell environment. Then change directory into the root of the project so that the dot (`.`) is interpreted correctly.

    * If you leave out the `-t` (same as `--image`) option, the command queues a local context build without pushing it to the registry. Building without pushing can be useful to check that the image builds.

1. Confirm that the container image was created by using the [az acr repository list][20] command:

    ```azurecli
    az acr repository list --name $REGISTRY_NAME
    ```

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

These steps require the [Docker extension][6] for VS Code.

1. Create an Azure Container Registry instance.

    Start the **Create Registry** task:

    1. Select the F1 key or CtrlL+Shift+P to open the command palette.
    1. Type **Azure Container Registry**.
    1. Select the task **Azure Container Registry: Create Registry**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-registry.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for the task to create a new Azure Container Registry instance in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-build-image-01.png":::

    Follow the prompts to create a registry and a resource group:

    * If you're prompted, select the subscription where you want to create resources for this tutorial.
    * **Registry name**: The registry name must be unique within Azure and contain 5 to 50 alphanumeric characters.
    * **Select a SKU**: Select **Basic**.
    * **Create a new resource group**: Select this option to create the resource group.
    * **Resource group**: Create a new resource group named **pythoncontainer-rg**.
    * **Location**: Select a location and wait for the notification that indicates the registry was created.

1. Build the image.

    Start the **Build Image in Azure** task:

    1. Select the F1 key or Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.
    1. Type **Azure Container Registry**.
    1. Select the task **Azure Container Registry: Build Image in Azure**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-build-image-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for the task to build a new Azure Container Registry container image in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-build-image-01.png":::

    Alternatively, you can right-click the Dockerfile and select **Build Image in Azure** to start the task to build the image. If the **Build Image in Azure** task doesn't appear, make sure you're signed in to Azure.

    Follow the prompts to build the image:

    * **Tag image as**: Enter **pythoncontainer:latest**.
    * **Registry provider**: Select **Azure**.
    * If you're prompted, select your subscription.
    * **Registry**: Select the container registry from the list.
    * **Select OS**: Select **Linux**.

    Monitor progress in the **Output** window and confirm that the image builds successfully. If an error occurs, see the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshoot-deployment).

1. Confirm that the registry was created.

    Select the Docker extension and go to the **REGISTRIES** section. Expand the Azure node to find the new Azure Container Registry instance.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-build-image-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example Azure Container Registry instance in the area for registries in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-build-image-03.png":::

1. Use the [az acr update][29] command to enable the administrator user account for the registry. You can run the command in the VS Code terminal window or [Azure Cloud Shell][4].

    ```azurecli
    az acr update --name <registry-name> \
        --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg \
        --admin-enabled true
    ```

    Alternatively, you can select the registry in the Docker extension, right-click, and then select **Open in Portal**. Then you can follow the instructions on the **Azure portal** tab in this section of the tutorial to enable the administrator user account.

    You can view the credentials created for the admin account by using these commands:

    ```azurecli
    az acr credential show \
        --name  <registry-name> \
        --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg
    ```

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal][3], search for **container registry**. Under **Marketplace** in the results, select **Container Registry**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values:

    * **Resource group**: Select **Create new** and enter **pythoncontainer-rg**.
    * **Registry name**: The registry name must be unique within Azure and contain 5 to 50 alphanumeric characters.
    * **Location**: Select a location near you.
    * **SKU**: Select **Basic**.

    When you finish, select **Review + create**. After validation is complete, select **Create**.

1. When deployment finishes, select **Go to resource**. If you miss this notification, you can search for **container registry** and select your registry under **Resources** in the results.

1. Enable the administrator user account:
    1. On the service menu, under **Settings**, select **Access Keys**.
    1. Select the **Admin user** checkbox.

1. To finish the configuration and build an image, select the Azure Cloud Shell icon on the top menu bar.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/azure-portal-build-image-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure Cloud Shell icon in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/azure-portal-build-image-02.png":::

    You can also [go directly to Azure Cloud Shell][4].

1. Use the [az acr build][5] command to build the image from the repo:

    ```azurecli
    az acr build --registry <registry-name> \
        --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg \ 
        --image pythoncontainer:latest <repo-path>
    ```

    Specify *\<registry-name>* as the name of the registry that you created. For *\<repo-path>*, choose either the [Django][1] or [Flask][2] repo path.

1. After the command finishes, under **Services**, select **Repositories** and confirm that the image appears.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this section create a container registry in the Basic service tier. This tier is cost-optimized, with a feature set and throughput targeted for developer scenarios, and is suitable for the requirements of this tutorial. In production scenarios, you would most likely use either the Standard or Premium service tier. These tiers provide enhanced levels of storage and throughput.

## Create a PostgreSQL Flexible Server instance

The sample app ([Django][1] or [Flask][2]) stores restaurant review data in a PostgreSQL database. In these steps, you create the server that will contain the database.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Use the [az postgres flexible-server create][22] command to create the PostgreSQL server in Azure. It isn't uncommon for this command to run for a few minutes before it finishes.

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    ADMIN_USERNAME=demoadmin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin-password> # Use a strong password that meets the requirements for PostgreSQL.
    POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME=<postgres-server-name> 
    az postgres flexible-server create \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
      --name $POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME \
      --location $LOCATION \
      --admin-user $ADMIN_USERNAME \
      --admin-password $ADMIN_PASSWORD \
      --version 16 \
      --tier Burstable \
      --sku-name Standard_B1ms \
      --public-access 0.0.0.0 \
      --microsoft-entra-auth Enabled \
      --storage-size 32 \
      --backup-retention 7 \
      --high-availability Disabled \
      --yes

    ```

    Use these values:

    * *\<postgres-server-name>*: The PostgreSQL database server name. This name must be unique across all of Azure. The server endpoint is `https://<postgres-server-name>.postgres.database.azure.com`. Allowed characters are `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, and hyphen (`-`).

    * *\<location>*: Use the same location that you used for the web app. *\<location>* is one of the Azure location `Name` values from the output of the command `az account list-locations -o table`.

    * *\<admin-username>*: The username for the administrator account. It can't be `azure_superuser`, `admin`, `administrator`, `root`, `guest`, or `public`. Use `demoadmin` for this tutorial.

    * *\<admin-password>*: The password of the administrator user. It must contain 8 to 128 characters from three of the following categories: English uppercase letters, English lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > When you're creating usernames or passwords, *do not* use the dollar sign ($) character. Later, when you create environment variables with these values, that character has a special meaning within the Linux container that you use to run Python apps.

    * `--version`: Use `16`. It specifies the PostgreSQL version to use for the server.

    * `--tier`: Use `Burstable`. It specifies the pricing tier for the server. The Burstable tier is a lower-cost option for workloads that don't need the full CPU continuously, and is suitable for the requirements of this tutorial.

    * `--sku-name`: The name of the pricing tier and compute configuration; for example, `Standard_B1ms`. For more information, see [Azure Database for PostgreSQL pricing][24]. To list available tiers, use `az postgres flexible-server list-skus --location <location>`.

    * `--public-access`: Use `0.0.0.0`. It allows public access to the server from any Azure service, such as Container Apps.

    * `--microsoft-entra-auth`: Use `Enabled`. It enables Microsoft Entra authentication on the server.

    * `--storage-size`: Use `32`. It specifies the storage size in gigabytes (GB) for the server. The minimum is 32 GB.

    * `--backup-retention`: Use `7`. It specifies the number of days to retain backups for the server. The minimum is 7 days.

    * `--high-availability`: Use `Disabled`. It disables high availability for the server. High availability is not required for this tutorial.

    * `--yes`: It accepts the terms of use for the PostgreSQL server.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you plan to work with the PostgreSQL server from your local workstation by using tools, you need to add a firewall rule for your workstation's IP address by using the [az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create][28] command.

1. Use the [az ad signed-in-user show](/cli/azure/ad/signed-in-user#az-ad-signed-in-user-show) command to get the object ID of your user account. You use this ID in the next command.

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    CALLER_OBJECT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
    CALLER_DISPLAY_NAME=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query userPrincipalName -o tsv)
    ```

1. Use the [az postgres flexible-server ad-admin create](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/ad-admin#az-postgres-flexible-server-ad-admin-create) command to add your user account as a Microsoft Entra administrator on the PostgreSQL server:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    az postgres flexible-server microsoft-entra-admin create \
      --server-name "$POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME" \
      --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME" \
      --display-name "$CALLER_DISPLAY_NAME" \
      --object-id "$CALLER_OBJECT_ID" \
      --type User

    ```

1. Use the [az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create][28] command to add a rule that allows your web app to access the PostgreSQL flexible server. In the following command, you configure the server's firewall to accept connections from your development workstation by using your public IP address:

    ```azurecli
    MY_IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)
    az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create \
      --name "$POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME" \
      --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME" \
      --rule-name allow-my-ip \
      --start-ip-address "$MY_IP" \
      --end-ip-address "$MY_IP"
        ```

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

These steps require the [Azure Databases extension][26] for VS Code.

1. Start the PostgreSQL **Create Server** task:

    1. Select the F1 key or Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.
    1. Type **Azure Databases**.
    1. Select the task **Azure Databases: Create Server**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-postgres-server-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for the task to create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-postgres-server-01.png":::

    Alternatively, you can select the **Azure** extension, go to **RESOURCES**, and expand your subscription. (Make sure you're viewing resources by **Group by Resource Type**.) Then,
    right-click **PostgreSQL servers** and select  **Create server** to start the same task.

1. A series of prompts guides you through the process of creating the server. Fill in the information as follows:

    * If you're asked to select a subscription, select the subscription that you're using for this tutorial.

    * **Select an Azure Database Server**: Select **PostgreSQL Flexible Server**.

    * **Server name**: Specify a name for the database server. The name must be unique across all of Azure. The database server's URL becomes `https://<server-name>.postgres.database.azure.com`. Allowed characters are **A** to **Z**, **0** to **9**, and hyphen (**-**). For example: *postgres-db-\<unique-id>*.

    * **Select the Postgres SKU and options**: Select the **B1ms Basic** tier (one vCore, 2-GiB memory, 5-GB storage).

    * **Administrator Username**: Create a username for an administrator account on the database server. Use **demoadmin** for this tutorial.

    * **Administrator Password**: Create a password for the administrator and confirm it.

    * **Select a resource group for new resources**: Select a resource group to contain the server. Use the same resource group where you created the container registry **pythoncontainer-rg**.

    * **Select a location for new resources**: Select the same location as the resource group and container registry.

    Monitor progress in the **Azure** window and confirm that the server is created successfully. If an error occurs, see the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshoot-deployment).

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-postgres-server-02.gif" alt-text="Animated screenshot that shows selections for completing the task of creating an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-postgres-server-02.gif":::

1. After the server is created, configure access from your local environment to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL server:

    1. Confirm that the server was created by checking the **Azure: Activity Log** window.

    1. Open the command palette (select the F1 key or Ctrl+Shift+P).

    1. Search for and select **PostgreSQL: Configure Firewall**. Select a subscription if you're prompted.

    1. Select **PostgreSQL servers (Flexible)**, and then select the server that you created in the previous step. If the server doesn't appear in the list, it's likely still being created.

    1. Select **Yes** in the dialog to add your IP address to the firewall rules of the PostgreSQL server.

       :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-postgres-server-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the confirmation dialog for adding a local workstation IP as a firewall rule for an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-postgres-server-04.png":::

1. The following steps require the Azure CLI. If you have the Azure CLI installed locally, you can run them in a terminal prompt. Otherwise, open [Azure Cloud Shell][4] in a browser.

1. Use the [az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/firewall-rule#az-postgres-flexible-server-firewall-rule-create) command to add a rule that allows your web app to access the PostgreSQL flexible server. In the following command, you configure the server's firewall to accept connections from all Azure resources:

    ```azurecli
    az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create \
        --name <postgres-server_name> \
        --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg \
        --rule-name AllowAllAzureServices \
        --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 \
        --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0
    ```

1. Use the [az postgres flexible-server update](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server#az-postgres-flexible-server-update) command to enable Microsoft Entra authentication on the server:

    ```azurecli
    az postgres flexible-server update \
        --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg \
        --name <postgres-server-name> 
        --active-directory-auth Enabled
    ```

1. Use the [az ad signed-in-user show](/cli/azure/ad/signed-in-user#az-ad-signed-in-user-show) command to get the object ID of your user account. You use this ID in the next command.

    ```azurecli
    az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv
    ```

1. Use the [az postgres flexible-server ad-admin create](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/ad-admin#az-postgres-flexible-server-ad-admin-create) command to add your user account as a Microsoft Entra administrator on the PostgreSQL server:

    ```azurecli
    az postgres flexible-server ad-admin create \
       --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg \
       --server-name <postgres-server-name>  \
       --display-name <your-email-address> \
       --object-id <your-account-object-id>
    ```

    For your account object ID, use the value that you got in the previous step.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal][3], search for **postgresql flexible**. Under **Marketplace** in the results, select **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values:

    * **Resource group**: Enter the resource group used in this tutorial, **pythoncontainer-rg**.
    * **Server name**: Enter a name for the database server that's unique across Azure. The database server's URL becomes `https://<server-name>.postgres.database.azure.com`. Allowed characters are **A** to **Z**, **0** to **9**, and hyphen (**-**). For example: *postgres-db-\<unique-id>*.
    * **Region**: Select the same region that you used for the resource group.
    * **Workload type**: Select **Development**.
    * **Authentication method**: Select **PostgreSQL and Microsoft Entra authentication**.
    * **Set Microsoft Entra admin**: Select **Set admin**. On the **Select Microsoft Entra Admins** pane, search for your Azure user account, select it in the results, and then click **Select**.
    * **Admin username**: Use **demoadmin**.
    * **Password** and **Confirm password**: Enter a password for the admin account.

    For all other settings, leave the defaults. When you finish, select **Next: Networking**.

1. On the **Networking** tab, enter the following values:

    * **Connectivity method**: Make sure **Public access (allowed IP addresses) and Private endpoint** is selected.
    * **Allow public access to this resource through the internet using a public IP address**: Make sure the checkbox is selected.
    * **Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server**: Select the checkbox.
    * **Add current client IP address**: Select (add) if you plan to access the database from your local server.

    For all other settings, leave the defaults. Select **Review + Create** to continue.

1. Review the settings. When you're satisfied, select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this section create a PostgreSQL server with a single vCore and limited memory in the Burstable pricing tier. The Burstable tier is a lower-cost option for workloads that don't need the full CPU continuously, and is suitable for the requirements of this tutorial. For production workloads, you might upgrade to either the General Purpose or Memory Optimized pricing tier. These tiers provide higher performance but increase costs.

## Create a database on the server

At this point, you have a PostgreSQL server. In this section, you create a database on the server.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the [az postgres flexible-server db create][27] command to create a database named *restaurants_reviews*:

```azurecli
#!/bin/bash
DATABASE_NAME=restaurants_reviews
az postgres flexible-server db create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --server-name $POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME \
    --database-name $DATABASE_NAME
```

You could also use the [az postgres flexible-server connect][16] command to connect to the database and then work with [psql][15] commands. When you're working with psql, it's often easier to use [Azure Cloud Shell][4] because the shell includes all the dependencies for you.

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

These steps require the [Azure Databases extension][26] for VS Code.

1. In the Azure Databases extension, find the PostgreSQL server that you created, right-click it, and then select **Create Database**.

1. At the prompt, enter **restaurants_reviews** as the **Database Name** value.

If you have trouble creating the database, the server might still be processing the firewall rule from the previous step. Wait a moment and try again. If you're prompted to enter credentials to access the database, use the **demoadmin** username and the password that you entered when you created the database.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your PostgreSQL server. For example, you can enter the name of your PostgreSQL server on the search bar and select it under **Resources** in the results.

1. On the service menu, under **Settings**, select **Databases**.

1. On the top menu of the **Databases** pane, select **Add**.

1. On the **Create Database** pane, enter **restaurants_reviews** for **Name**, and then select **Save**.

1. When the operation finishes, you return to the **Databases** pane. Verify that **restaurants_reviews** appears in the list of databases. You might need to refresh the pane for it to appear.

---

You can also connect to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server and create a database by using [psql][15] or an IDE that supports PostgreSQL, like [Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio). For steps using psql, see [Configure the managed identity on the PostgreSQL database](#configure-the-managed-identity-on-the-postgresql-database) later in this article.

## Create a user-assigned managed identity

Create a user-assigned managed identity to use as the identity for the container app when it's running in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a user-assigned managed identity, your account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-contributor) role assignment.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the [az identity create](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-create) command to create a user-assigned managed identity:

```azurecli
UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME=<managed-identity-name> # Use a unique name for the managed identity, such as-"my-ua-managed-id".
az identity create \
    --name $UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME 
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
```

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

There isn't currently a VS Code extension that supports creating user-assigned managed identities. Follow the steps for the Azure CLI or the Azure portal.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for **managed identity**. Under **Marketplace** in the results, select **User Assigned Managed Identity**.
1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values:

    * **Subscription**: Select the subscription that you're using for the resources in this tutorial.
    * **Resource group**: Enter the resource group for this tutorial, **pythoncontainer-rg**.
    * **Region**: Select the region that you're using for the resources in this tutorial.
    * **Name**: Enter the name for your user-assigned managed identity. For this tutorial, use **my-ua-managed-id**. You can use a different name, but the commands in this tutorial assume **my-ua-managed-id**. If you use a different name, you'll have to change it in other commands.

1. Select **Review + create** to review the changes.
1. Select **Create**.

## Configure the managed identity on the PostgreSQL database

Configure the managed identity as a role on the PostgreSQL server and then grant it necessary permissions for the *restaurants_reviews* database. Whether you're using the Azure CLI or psql, you must connect to the Azure PostgreSQL server with a user who's configured as a Microsoft Entra admin on your server instance. Only Microsoft Entra accounts configured as a PostgreSQL admin can configure managed identities and other Microsoft admin roles on your server.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/configure-database-azure-cli)

1. Get an access token for your Azure account by using the [az account get-access-token](/cli/azure/account#az-account-get-access-token) command. You use the access token in the next steps.

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    MY_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource-type oss-rdbms --output tsv --query accessToken)
    echo $MY_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

1. Add the user-assigned managed identity as database role on your PostgreSQL server by using the [az postgres flexible-server execute](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server#az-postgres-flexible-server-execute) command:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    az postgres flexible-server execute \
      --name "$POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME" \
      --admin-user "$CALLER_DISPLAY_NAME" \
      --admin-password "$ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      --database-name postgres \
      --querytext "SELECT * FROM pgaadauth_create_principal('$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME', false, false);"
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're running the `az postgres flexible-server execute` command on your local workstation, make sure that you added a firewall rule for your workstation's IP address. You can add a rule by using the [az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create][28] command. The same requirement also exists for the command in the next step.

1. Grant the user-assigned managed identity the necessary permissions on the *restaurants_reviews* database by using the following [az postgres flexible-server execute](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server#az-postgres-flexible-server-execute) command:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    SQL_GRANTS=$(cat <<EOF
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE $DATABASE_NAME TO "$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME";
    GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO "$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME";
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME";
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO "$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME";
    EOF
    )

    az postgres flexible-server execute \
      --name "$POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME" \
      --admin-user "$CALLER_DISPLAY_NAME" \
      --admin-password "$MY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      --database-name "$DATABASE_NAME" \
      --querytext "$SQL_GRANTS"
    
    ```

    This Azure CLI command connects to the *restaurants_reviews* database on the server and issues the following SQL commands:

    ```sql
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE restaurants_reviews TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    ```

### [psql](#tab/configure-database-psql)

You can use the PostgreSQL interactive terminal [psql][15] in your local environment or in [Azure Cloud Shell][4], which is also accessible in the [Azure portal][3]. When you're working with psql, it's often easier to use Cloud Shell because the shell includes all the dependencies for you.

1. Connect to the database with psql by using the Azure account that you previously configured as a Microsoft Entra admin on your server:

    ```bash
    psql --host=<postgres-server-name>.postgres.database.azure.com \
         --port=5432 \
         --username=<your-azure-email-address> \
         --dbname=postgres \
         --set sslmode=require
    ```

    In the command, *\<postgres-server-name>* is the name of the PostgreSQL server, and *\<your-azure-email-address>* is the email address of your Azure account. The command prompts you for your Azure account password.

    If you're working in Azure Cloud Shell or if you have the Azure CLI installed on your local system, you can use the [az account get-access-token](/cli/azure/account#az-account-get-access-token) command to get an access token that you can copy and enter as the password:

    ```azurecli
    az account get-access-token --resource-type oss-rdbms --output tsv --query accessToken
    ```

    Or, you can combine the psql and Azure CLI commands:

    ```bash
    psql "host=<postgres-server-name>.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=postgres user=<your-azure-email-address> password='$(az account get-access-token --resource-type oss-rdbms --output tsv --query accessToken)' sslmode=require"
    ```

    Be sure to replace the *\<postgres-server-name>* and *\<your-azure-email-address>* placeholders before running the command.

    If you have trouble connecting, restart the database and try again. If you're connecting from your local environment, your IP address must be added to the firewall rule list for the database service.

1. Add the user-assigned managed identity as database role on your PostgreSQL server.

    At the `postgres=>` prompt, enter:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pgaadauth_create_principal('my-ua-managed-id', false, false);SELECT * FROM pgaadauth_list_principals(false);
    ```

    The semicolon (`;`) at the end of each command is necessary. To verify that the database was successfully created, use the command `\c restaurants_reviews`. Enter `\?` to show help or `\q` to quit.

1. Connect to the *restaurants_reviews* database by using the `\c` (connect) command:

    ```SQL
    \c restaurants_reviews
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you haven't yet created the *restaurants_reviews* database, you can do so by using the following command:
    >
    > ```sql
    > CREATE DATABASE resaurants_reviews
    > ```

1. Grant the user-assigned managed identity the necessary permissions on the *restaurants_reviews* database.

    At the `restaurants_reviews_=>` prompt, enter the following commands:

    ```sql
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE restaurants_reviews TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO "my-ua-managed-id";
    ```

1. Quit psql by using the `\q` command:

    ```SQL
    \q
    ```

## Deploy the web app to Container Apps

Container apps are deployed to Azure Container Apps [*environments*][30], which act as a secure boundary. In the following steps, you create the environment and a container inside the environment. You then configure the container so that the website is visible externally.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

These steps require the Azure Container Apps extension, *containerapp*.

1. Create a Container Apps environment by using the [az containerapp env create][13] command:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    APP_ENV_NAME=<app-env-name> # Use a unique name for the environment, such as "python-container-env".
    az containerapp env create \
    --name python-container-env \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --location $LOCATION
    ```

1. Get the sign-in credentials for the Azure Container Registry instance by using the [az acr credential show](/cli/azure/acr/credential#az-acr-credential-show) command:

    ```azurecli
    #!/bin/bash
    REGISTRY_CREDS=$(az acr credential show -n "$REGISTRY_NAME" --query "[username,passwords[0].value]" -o tsv)
    REGISTRY_USERNAME=$(echo "$REGISTRY_CREDS" | head -n1)
    REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(echo "$REGISTRY_CREDS" | tail -n1)
    ```

    You use the username and one of the passwords returned from the command's output when you create the container app in step 5.

1. Use the [az identity show](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-show) command to get the client ID and resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity:

    ```azurecli
    UA_CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show \
        --name "$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME" \
        --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
        --query clientId -o tsv)
    UA_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show \
        --name "$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME" \
        --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
        --query id -o tsv)
    ```

    You use the value of the client ID (GUID) and the resource ID from the command's output when you create the container app in step 5. The resource ID has the following form: `/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/pythoncontainer-rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/my-ua-managed-id`.

1. Run the following command to generate a secret key value:

    ```azurecli
    AZURE_SECRET_KEY=$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())')
    ```

    You use the secret key value to set an environment variable when you create the container app in step 5.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The command that this step shows is for a Bash shell. Depending on your environment, you might need to invoke Python by using  `python3`. On Windows, you need to enclose the command in the `-c` parameter in double quotation marks rather than single quotation marks. You also might need to invoke Python by using `py` or `py -3`, depending on your environment.

1. Create a container app in the environment by using the [az containerapp create][12] command:

    ```azurecli
    az containerapp create \
      --name "$CONTAINER_APP_NAME" \
      --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
      --environment "$APP_ENV" \
      --image "$REGISTRY_NAME.azurecr.io/$IMAGE_NAME" \
      --target-port "$TARGET_PORT" \
      --ingress external \
      --registry-server "$REGISTRY_NAME.azurecr.io" \
      --registry-username "$REGISTRY_USERNAME" \
      --registry-password "$REGISTRY_PASSWORD" \
      --user-assigned "$UA_RESOURCE_ID" \
      --env-vars \
          DBHOST="$POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME" \
          DBNAME="$DATABASE_NAME" \
          DBUSER="$UA_MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME" \
          RUNNING_IN_PRODUCTION=1 \
          AZURE_CLIENT_ID="$UA_CLIENT_ID" \
          AZURE_SECRET_KEY="$AZURE_SECRET_KEY"
        ```

1. For Django only, migrate and create a database schema. (In the Flask sample app, it's done automatically, and you can skip this step.)

    Connect by using the [az containerapp exec][31] command:

    ```azurecli
        az containerapp exec \
            --name $CONTAINER_APP_NAME \
            --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
    ```

    Then, at the shell command prompt, enter `python manage.py migrate`.

    You don't need to migrate for revisions of the container.

1. Test the website.

    The `az containerapp create` command that you entered previously outputs an application URL that you can use to browse to the app. The URL ends in `azurecontainerapps.io`. Go to the URL in a browser. Alternatively, you can use the [az containerapp browse](/cli/azure/containerapp#az-containerapp-browse) command.

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

These steps require the [Azure Container Apps extension][11] for VS Code.

1. Get values that you need for environment variables:

    1. Open a terminal in VS Code for the following Azure CLI commands. You can also enter the commands from Azure Cloud Shell.

    1. Get the client ID of the managed identity by using the [az identity show](/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-show) command:

        ```azurecli
        az identity show --name my-ua-managed-id --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg --query clientId -o tsv
        ```

        The client ID is a GUID. You use it to set an environment variable in the next step.

    1. Generate a secret key value:

        ```bash
        python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'
        ```

        You use the secret key value to set an environment variable in the next step.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The command shown here is for a Bash shell. Depending on your environment, you might need to invoke Python by using `python3`. On Windows, you need to enclose the command in the `-c` parameter in double quotation marks rather than single quotation marks. You also might need to invoke Python by using `py` or `py -3`.

1. Create an *.env* file that you'll reference during the creation of the container app.

    The sample repo includes an *.env.example* file that you can start from. Create the *.env* file with the following values:

    ```python
    DBHOST="<postgres-server-name>"
    DBNAME="restaurants_reviews"
    DBUSER="my-ua-managed-id"
    RUNNING_IN_PRODUCTION="1"
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<managed-identity-client-id>"
    AZURE_SECRET_KEY="<your-secret-key>"
    ```

    The `DBUSER` value is the name of your user-assigned managed identity.

    The `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` value is the client ID of your user-assigned managed identity. You got it in the previous step.

    The `AZURE_SECRET_KEY` value is the secret key value that you generated in the previous step.

1. Create a Container Apps environment.

    Start the **Create Container Apps Environment** task:

    1. Select the F1 key or Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.
    1. Type **container apps**.
    1. Select the task **Azure Container Apps: Create Container Apps Environment**.

    Alternatively, you can open the Azure extension and select the plus (**+**) icon in the **Resources** section.

    Follow the prompts to create the Container Apps environment:

    * If you're prompted, select your subscription.
    * **Enter a container apps environment name**: Enter **python-container-env**.
    * **Select a location for new resources**: Choose the same location as the resource group that you created previously.

    Creating the environment takes several minutes. A notification shows the progress of the operation. Look for "Successfully created new Container Apps environment" before you go to the next step. The environment is created in a resource group of the same name, *python-container-env*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-container-app-02.gif" alt-text="Animated screenshot that shows selections for creating an Azure Container Apps environment in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-container-app-02.gif":::

1. Create a container app in the new environment by finding the **Azure Container Apps: Create Container App** task in the command palette.

    Start the **Create Container App** task:

    1. Select the F1 key or Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.
    1. Type **container apps**.
    1. Select the task **Azure Container Apps: Create Container App**.

    Alternatively, you can open the Azure extension and go to the **Container Apps** section. Select the environment, right-click, and then select **Create Container App** to start the task.

    Follow the prompts to create the container app:

    * **Select subscription**: Select the subscription that you're using for this tutorial.
    * **Select a container apps environment**: Select the environment that you created in the previous step.
    * **Enter a container app name**: Enter **python-container-app**.
    * **Select an image source for the container app**: Select **Container Registry**.
    * **Select a container registry**: Select **Azure Container Registry**.
    * **Select an Azure Container Registry**: Select the name of the registry that you created previously.
    * **Select a repository**: Select **pythoncontainer**.
    * **Select a tag**: Select **latest**.
    * **Select a .env file to set the environment variables for the container instance**: Select the *.env* file that you created in step 2.
    * **Enable ingress for applications that need an HTTP endpoint**: Select **Enable**.
    * **Select the HTTP traffic that the endpoint will accept**: Select **External**.
    * **Port the container is listening on**: Set to **8000** for Django or **5000** for Flask.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-container-app-03.gif" alt-text="Animated screenshot that shows selections for creating an Azure container app in an environment in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-container-app-03.gif":::

    A notification shows the progress of the operation. Look for "Successfully created new Container Apps environment" before you go to the next step. The container app is created in the same resource group as the Container Apps environment *python-container-env*.

1. Configure the user-assigned managed identity on the newly created container app:

    1. Open a terminal in VS Code for the following Azure CLI commands. You can also enter the commands from Azure Cloud Shell.

    1. Get the resource ID of the managed identity:

        ```azurecli
        az identity show --name my-ua-managed-id --resource-group pythoncontainer-rg --query id -o tsv
        ```

        The resource ID has the following form: */subscriptions/\<subscription ID>/resourcegroups/pythoncontainer-rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/my-ua-managed-id*.

    1. Assign the managed identity to the container app by using the [az containerapp identity assign](/cli/azure/containerapp/identity#az-containerapp-identity-assign) command:

        ```azurecli
        az containerapp identity assign  \
            --name python-container-app \
            --resource-group container-app-environment  \
            --user-assigned <managed-identity-resource-id>      
        ```

        Replace the `<managed-identity-resource-id>` placeholder with the resource ID from the output of the previous command.

        The resource group in this command is the same resource group in which you created the Container Apps environment and the container app, *python-container-app*.

1. For Django only, migrate and create a database schema. (In the Flask sample app, it's done automatically, and you can skip this step.)

    1. Go to the **Azure** extension and expand the **Container Apps** section. Find and expand your container environment, right-click the container app that you created, and then select **Open Console in Portal**.
    1. Choose a startup command and select **Connect**.
    1. At the shell prompt, enter `python manage.py migrate`.

    You don't need to migrate for revisions of the container.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/azure-portal-create-container-app-11.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selections for connecting to an Azure Container Apps container in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/azure-portal-create-container-app-11.png":::

1. Test the website.

    After the **Create Container App** task finishes, a notification appears with a **Browse** button to go to the website.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-container-app-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button for browsing to an Azure container app after it's created in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="media/tutorial-container-apps/visual-studio-code-create-container-app-04.png":::

    If you miss the notification, go to the **Azure** extension and expand the **Container Apps** section. Find and expand your container environment, right-click the container app, and then select **Browse**. You can also enter the **Azure Container Apps: Browse** task in the command palette and follow the prompts.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Get the client ID for the user-assigned managed identity. You use it in a later step.

    1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for **my-ua-managed-id** and select it under **Resources** in the results.
    1. On the service menu, select **Overview** and note down the **Client ID** value.

1. Open Azure Cloud Shell and enter the following command to get a secret key value:

    ```python
    python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'
    ```

    You use the secret key value to set an environment variable in a later step.

1. In the portal, search for **container apps**. Under **Marketplace** in the results, select **Container App**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values:

    * **Resource group**: Use the previously created group that contains the Azure Container Registry instance.
    * **Container app name**: Enter **python-container-app**.
    * **Deployment source**: Make sure that **Container image** is selected.
    * **Region**: Use the same region/location as the resource group.
    * **Container Apps Environment**: Select **Create new** to create a new environment named *python-container-env*.

    Select **Next: Container** to continue the configuration.

1. On the **Container** tab, continue configuring the container app:

    * **Use quickstart image**: Make sure the checkbox is cleared.
    * **Image source**: Make sure **Azure Container Registry** is selected.
    * **Registry**: Select the name of registry that you created earlier.
    * **Image**: Select **pythoncontainer** (the name of the image that you built).
    * **Image tag**: Select **latest**.

    Under **Environment variables**, enter values for the following variables:

    * **DBHOST**=*\<postgres-server-name>*
    * **DBNAME**=**restaurants_reviews**
    * **DBUSER**=**my-ua-managed-id**
    * **RUNNING_IN_PRODUCTION**=**1**
    * **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**=*\<managed-identity-client-id>*
    * **AZURE_SECRET_KEY**=*\<your-secret-key>*

    For **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**, use the client ID that you copied for the user-assigned managed identity.

    For **AZURE_SECRET_KEY**, use the secret key value that you generated in a previous step.

    Select **Next: Ingress** to continue.

1. On the **Ingress** tab, continue configuring the container app:

    * **Ingress**:  Select the **Enabled** checkbox. More selections appear.
    * **Ingress traffic**: Select **Accepting traffic from anywhere**.
    * **Target port**: Set to **8000** for Django or **5000** for Flask.

    Select **Review + create**.

1. Review the settings, and then select **Create** to start deployment.

1. After the deployment finishes, select **Go to resource**.

1. Add the user-assigned managed identity to the container app:

    1. On the service menu, under **Security**, select **Identity**.
    1. On the **User assigned** tab, select **Add**.
    1. On the **Add user assigned managed identity** pane, select **my-ua-managed-identity**, and then select **Add**.
    1. When the operation finishes, you return to the **User assigned** tab. Verify that **my-ua-managed-id** appears in the list of identities.

    > [!TIP]
    > Instead of adding the managed identity and defining environment variables, you can use a [service connector][9]. A service connector helps you connect Azure compute services to other backing services by configuring connection information and by generating and storing environment variables for you.
    >
    > If you use a service connector, be sure to synchronize the environment variables in the sample code to the environment variables that you created with the service connector.

1. For Django only, migrate and create a database schema. (In the Flask sample app, it's done automatically, and you can skip this step.)

    1. On the service menu, under **Monitoring**, select **Console**.
    1. Choose a startup command and select **Connect**.
    1. At the shell prompt, enter `python manage.py migrate`.

    You don't need to migrate for revisions of the container.

## Troubleshoot deployment

### You forgot the application URL to access the website

In the Azure portal:

* Go to the **Overview** page of the container app and look for **Application Url**.

In VS Code:

1. Go to the **Azure view** (Ctrl+Shift+A) and expand the subscription that you're working in.
1. Expand the **Container Apps** node, expand the managed environment, right-click **python-container-app**, and then select **Browse**. VS Code opens the browser with the application URL.

In the Azure CLI:

* Use the command `az containerapp show -g pythoncontainer-rg -n python-container-app --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn`.

### In VS Code, the Build Image in Azure task returns an error

If you see the message "Error: failed to download context. Please check if the URL is incorrect" in the VS Code **Output** window, refresh the registry in the Docker extension. To refresh, select the Docker extension, go to the **Registries** section, find the registry, and select it.

If you run the **Build Image in Azure** task again, check whether your registry from a previous run exists. If so, use it.

### In the Azure portal, an access error appears during the creation of a container app

An access error that contains "Cannot access ACR '\<name>.azurecr.io'" occurs when admin credentials on an Azure Container Registry instance are disabled.

To check admin status in the portal, go to your Azure Container Registry instance, select the **Access keys** resource, and ensure that **Admin user** is enabled.

### Your container image doesn't appear in the Azure Container Registry instance

* Check the output of the Azure CLI command or VS Code output and look for messages to confirm success.
* Check that the name of the registry was specified correctly in your build command with the Azure CLI or in the VS Code task prompts.
* Make sure your credentials aren't expired. For example, in VS Code, find the target registry in the Docker extension and refresh. In the Azure CLI, run `az login`.

### Website returns "Bad Request (400)"

If you get a "Bad Request (400)" error, check the PostgreSQL environment variables passed in to the container. The 400 error often indicates that the Python code can't connect to the PostgreSQL instance.

The sample code used in this tutorial checks for the existence of the container environment variable `RUNNING_IN_PRODUCTION`, which can be set to any value (like `1`).

### Website returns "Not Found (404)"

* Check the **Application Url** value on the **Overview** page for the container. If the application URL contains the word "internal," ingress isn't set correctly.
* Check the ingress of the container. For example, in the Azure portal, go to the **Ingress** resource of the container. Make sure that **HTTP Ingress** is enabled and **Accepting traffic from anywhere** is selected.

### Website doesn't start, you get "stream timeout," or nothing is returned

* Check the logs:
  * In the Azure portal, go to the container app's revision management resource and check **Provision Status** for the container:
    * If the status is **Provisioning**, wait until provisioning finishes.
    * If the status is **Failed**, select the revision and view the console logs. Choose the order of the columns to show **Time Generated**, **Stream_s**, and **Log_s**. Sort the logs by most recent and look for Python `stderr` and `stdout` messages in the **Stream_s** column. Python `print` output is `stdout` messages.
  * In the Azure CLI, use the [az containerapp logs show][32] command.
* If you're using the Django framework, check to see if the *restaurants_reviews* tables exist in the database. If not, use a console to access the container and run `python manage.py migrate`.
