# Deploy a containerized Flask or FastAPI web app on Azure App Service

This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Python [Flask][5] or [FastAPI][6] web app to [Azure App Service][1] using the [Web App for Containers][2] feature. This approach provides a streamlined path for developers who want the benefits of a fully managed platform while deploying their app as a single containerized artifact with all dependencies included. For more information about using containers in Azure, see [Comparing Azure container options][3].

In this tutorial, you use the [Docker CLI][7] and [Docker][12] to optionally build and test a Docker image locally. You then use the [Azure CLI][8] to push the Docker image to [Azure Container Registry][11] (ACR) and deploy it to Azure App Service. The web app is configured with its system-assigned [managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for secure, passwordless access to pull the image from ACR using Azure role-based access control (RBAC). You can also deploy with [Visual Studio Code][9] with the [Azure Tools Extension][10] installed.

For an example of building and creating a Docker image to run on Azure Container Apps, see [Deploy a Flask or FastPI web app on Azure Container Apps][4].

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Docker image that can be deployed to Azure App Service. However, using a Docker image is not required to deploy to App Service. You can also deploy your application code directly from your local workspace to App Service without creating a Docker image. For an example, see [Quickstart: Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?toc=/azure/developer/python/toc.json&bc=/azure/developer/python/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* An Azure account where you can deploy a web app to [Azure App Service][1] and [Azure Container Registry][11]. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* [Azure CLI][8] to create a Docker image and deploy it to App Service. And optionally, [Docker][12]and the [Docker CLI][7] to create a Docker and test it in your local environment.

## Get the sample code

In your local environment, get the code.

### [Flask](#tab/web-app-flask)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart.git
cd msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart
```

### [FastAPI](#tab/web-app-fastapi)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-fastapi-webapp-quickstart.git
cd msdocs-python-fastapi-webapp-quickstart
```

---

## Add Dockerfile and \.dockerignore files

Add a *Dockerfile* to instruct Docker how to build the image. The *Dockerfile* specifies the use of [Gunicorn][13], a production-level web server that forwards web requests to the Flask and FastAPI frameworks. The ENTRYPOINT and CMD commands instruct Gunicorn to handle requests for the app object.

### [Flask](#tab/web-app-flask)

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM python:3.11

WORKDIR /code

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 50505

ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "app:app"]
```

`50505` is used for the container port (internal) in this example, but you can use any free port.

Check the *requirements.txt* file to make sure it contains `gunicorn`.

:::code language="python" source="~/../msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart/requirements.txt" highlight="2" :::

### [FastAPI](#tab/web-app-fastapi)

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM python:3.11

WORKDIR /code

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3100

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:3100", "main:app", "--worker-class", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker"]
```

`3100` is used for the container port (internal) in this example, but you can use any free port.

Check the *requirements.txt* file to make sure it contains `gunicorn` and `uvicorn`.

```
fastapi
uvicorn
gunicorn
```

---

Add a *\.dockerignore* file to exclude unnecessary files from the image.

```dockerignore
.git*
**/*.pyc
.venv/
```

## Configure gunicorn

Gunicorn can be configured with a *gunicorn.conf.py* file. When the *gunicorn.conf.py* file is located in the same directory where gunicorn is run, you don't need to specify its location in the *Dockerfile*. For more information about specifying the configuration file, see [Gunicorn settings][14].

In this tutorial, the suggested configuration file configures gunicorn to increase its number of workers based on the number of CPU cores available. For more information about *gunicorn.conf.py* file settings, see [Gunicorn configuration][15].

### [Flask](#tab/web-app-flask)

```text
# Gunicorn configuration file
import multiprocessing

max_requests = 1000
max_requests_jitter = 50

log_file = "-"

bind = "0.0.0.0:50505"

workers = (multiprocessing.cpu_count() * 2) + 1
threads = workers

timeout = 120
```

### [FastAPI](#tab/web-app-fastapi)

```text
# Gunicorn configuration file
import multiprocessing

max_requests = 1000
max_requests_jitter = 50

log_file = "-"

bind = "0.0.0.0:3100"

worker_class = "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker"
workers = (multiprocessing.cpu_count() * 2) + 1
```

With the `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` worker class, you can use `gunicorn` to run `FastAPI` apps. For more information, see [Running uvicorn with gunicorn][16].

---

## Build and run the image locally

Build the image locally.

### [Flask](#tab/web-app-flask)

```bash
docker build --tag flask-demo .
```

### [FastAPI](#tab/web-app-fastapi)

```bash
docker build --tag fastapi-demo .
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> If the `docker build` command returns an error, make sure the docker deamon is running. On Windows, make sure that Docker Desktop is running.

Run the image locally in a Docker container.

### [Flask](#tab/web-app-flask)

```bash
docker run --detach --publish 5000:50505 flask-demo
```

Open the ```http://localhost:5000``` URL in your browser to see the web app running locally.

### [FastAPI](#tab/web-app-fastapi)

```bash
docker run --detach --publish 3100:3100 fastapi-demo
```

Open the ```http://localhost:3100``` URL in your browser to see the web app running locally.

---

The `--detach` option runs the container in the background. The `--publish` option maps the container port to a port on the host. The host port (external) is first in the pair, and the container port (internal) is second. For more information, see [Docker run reference][17].

## Create a resource group and Azure Container Registry

1. Run the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command to [sign in to Azure](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Run the [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-upgrade) command to make sure your version of the Azure CLI is current.

    ```azurecli
    az upgrade
    ```

1. Create a group with the [az group create][18] command.

    ```azurecli
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=<resource-group-name>
    LOCATION=<location>
    az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION
    ```

    An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When creating a resource group, you specify a location such as *eastus*. Replace `<location>` with the location you choose. Certain SKUs are unavailable in certain locations, so you might get an error indicating this. Use a different location and try again.

1. Create an Azure Container Registry with the [az acr create][19] command. Replace `<container-registry-name>` with a unique name for your instance.

    ```azurecli
    CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME=<container-registry-name>
    az acr create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROOUP_NAME \
    --name $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME --sku Basic
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The registry name must be unique in Azure. If you get an error, try a different name. Registry names can consist of 5-50 alphanumeric characters. Hyphens and underscores are not allowed. To learn more, see [Azure Container Registry name rules](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules#microsoftcontainerregistry). If you use a different name, make sure that you use your name rather than `webappacr123` in the commands that reference the registry and registry artifacts in following sections.

    An Azure Container Registry is a private Docker registry that stores images for use in Azure Container Instances, Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, and other services. When creating a registry, you specify a name, SKU, and resource group.

## Build the image in Azure Container Registry

Build the Docker image in Azure with the [az acr build][21] command. The command uses the Dockerfile in the current directory, and pushes the image to the registry.

```azurecli
az acr build \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
  --registry $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME \
  --image webappsimple:latest .
```

The `--registry` option specifies the registry name, and the `--image` option specifies the image name. The image name is in the format `registry.azurecr.io/repository:tag`.

## Deploy web app to Azure

1. Create an App Service plan with the [az appservice plan][22] command.

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan create \
    --name webplan \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --sku B1 \
    --is-linux
    ```

1. Set an environment variable to your subscription ID. It's used in the `--scope` parameter in the next command.

    ```azurecli
    SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
    ```

    The command for creating the environment variable is shown for the Bash shell. Change the syntax as appropriate for other environments.

1. Create the web app with the [az webapp create][23] command.

    ```azurecli
    export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 # This line is for Windows users to prevent path conversion issues in Git Bash.
    az webapp create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --plan webplan --name <container-registry-name> \
    --assign-identity [system] \
    --role AcrPull \
    --scope /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --acr-use-identity --acr-identity [system] \
    --container-image-name $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME.azurecr.io/webappsimple:latest 
    ```

    Notes:

    * The web app name must be unique in Azure. If you get an error, try a different name. The name can consist of alphanumeric characters and hyphens, but can't start or end with a hyphen. To learn more, see [Microsoft.Web name rules](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules#microsoftweb).

    * If you're using a name different than `webappacr123` for your Azure Container Registry, make sure you update the `--container-image-name` parameter appropriately.

    * The `--assign-identity`, `--role`, and `--scope` parameters enable the system-assigned managed identity on the web app and assign it the [`AcrPull` role](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#acrpull) on the resource group. This gives the managed identity permission to pull images from any Azure Container Registry in the resource group.

    * The `--acr-use-identity` and `--acr-identity` parameters configure the web app to use its system-assigned managed identity to pull images from the Azure Container Registry.

    * It can take a few minutes for the web app to be created. You can check the deployment logs with the [az webapp log tail][27] command. For example, `az webapp log tail --resource-group web-app-simple-rg --name webappsimple123`. If you see entries with "warmup" in them, the container is being deployed.

    * The URL of the web app is `<web-app-name>.azurewebsites.net`, for example, `https://webappsimple123.azurewebsites.net`.

## Make updates and redeploy

After you make code changes, you can redeploy to App Service with the [az acr build][21] and [az webapp update][28] commands.

## Clean up

All the Azure resources created in this tutorial are in the same resource group. Removing the resource group removes all resources in the resource group and is the fastest way to remove all Azure resources used for your app.

To remove resources, use the [az group delete][24] command.

```azurecli
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --yes --no-wait
```

You can also remove the group in the [Azure portal][25] or in [Visual Studio Code][9] and the [Azure Tools Extension][10].
