# Get started with chat private endpoints for Python

This article shows you how to deploy and run the [Enterprise chat app sample for Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) accessible by private endpoints. Create a virtual machine, then connect via Azure Bastion from the Azure portal to access the virtual machine. Use a web browser on the virtual machine to access the chat app.

This sample implements a chat app using Python, Azure OpenAI Service, and [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) in Azure AI Search to get answers about employee benefits at a fictitious company. The app is seeded with PDF files including the employee handbook, a benefits document and a list of company roles and expectations.

By following the instructions in this article, you will:

- Deploy a chat app to Azure for public access in a web browser.
- Redeploy chat app with private endpoints.
- Access chat app through a VM with Bastion.

Once you complete this procedure, you can start modifying the new project with your custom code and redeploy, knowing your chat app is accessible only through the private VM with a private endpoint.

## Architectural overview

The default deployment creates a chat app with public endpoints.

For chat apps enriched with private data, securing access to your chat app is crucial. This article presents a solution using a virtual network (VNET). Deploying the sample with a virtual network introduces a problem. You can't access the chat app anymore because your client browser isn't in the virtual network. To resolve this issue, you need to create a virtual machine inside the virtual network.

Now that the virtual machine is in the same virtual network, use Azure Bastion to connect. From the Azure portal, use the VM remote desktop (RDP) to access the chat app. The VM is a Windows server with a Microsoft Edge browser. Use the same chat app endpoint, just through the VM's browser.

## Deployment steps

It's recommended to deploy the solution twice, once with public access to validate the chat app is working correctly, and again with private access to secure your chat app using a virtual network.

#### [GitHub Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces) runs a development container managed by GitHub with [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) as the user interface. For the most straightforward development environment, use GitHub Codespaces so that you have the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with 2 core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Start the process to create a new GitHub Codespace on the `main` branch of the [`Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) GitHub repository.
1. Right-click on the following button, and select _Open link in new windows_ in order to have both the development environment and the documentation available at the same time.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)

1. On the **Create codespace** page, review the Codespace configuration settings and then select **Create new codespace**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/github-create-codespace.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/github-create-codespace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the confirmation screen before creating a new codespace.":::

1. Wait for the Codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.

1. In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Copy the code from the terminal and then paste it into a browser. Follow the instructions to authenticate with your Azure account.

1. The remaining tasks in this article take place in the context of this development container.

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to be installed on your local machine. The extension hosts the development container locally using the Docker host with the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

1. Create a new local directory on your computer for the project.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-intelligent-app && cd my-intelligent-app
    ```

1. Open Visual Studio Code in that directory:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.

## Custom settings

This solution configures and deploys the infrastructure based on custom settings configured with Azure Developer CLI. The following table explains the custom settings for this solution.

|Setting|Description|
|--|----|
|`AZURE_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ACCESS`|Controls the value of public network access on supported Azure resources. Valid values are `Enabled` or `Disabled`.|
|`AZURE_USE_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT`|Controls deployment of private endpoints, which connect Azure resources to the virtual network. `TRUE` means private endpoints are deployed for connectivity.|
|`AZURE_PROVISION_VM`|Controls deployment of a [virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machines/overview) and [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview). Azure Bastion allows you to securely connect to the virtual machine, without connecting to the virtual network. Since the virtual machine is connected to the virtual network, you're able to access the chat app. You must set `AZURE_VM_USERNAME` and `AZURE_VM_PASSWORD` to provision the built-in administrator account with the virtual machine so you can sign in through Azure Bastion.|
|`AZURE_VM_USERNAME`| Sets the VM username.|
|`AZURE_VM_PASSWORD`| Sets the VM password.|

> [!CAUTION]
> This solution stores the unencrypted password in the local Azure Developer CLI environment. 

## Deploy the chat app

The first deployment creates the resources and provides a publicly accessible endpoint.

1. Run the following command to configure this solution for public access.

    ```console
    azd env set AZURE_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ACCESS Enabled
    ```

    When asked for an environment name, remember that the environment name is used to create the resource group. Enter a meaningful name. If you are on a team or in an organization, include your name: `morgan-chat-private-endpoints`. Make note of the environment name displayed in the console. You need it to find the resources in the Azure portal later.

1. Run the following command to include provisioning the virtual network resources. Remember the deployment doesn't restrict access until the second deployment.

    ```console
    azd env set AZURE_USE_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT true
    ```

1. Deploy the solution with the following command:

    ```console
    azd up
    ```

    Provisioning resources is the most time-consuming part of the deployment process. Wait for the deployment to complete before continuing.

1. At the end of the deployment process, the app endpoint is shown. Copy that endpoint into a browser to open the chat app. Select one of the questions on the cards then wait for the answer.

    Make note of the endpoint URL. You'll need it again later in the article.

## Deploy chat app to Azure with private access

Change the deployment configuration to secure the chat app for private access.

1. Run the following command to turn off public access.

    ```console
    azd env set AZURE_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ACCESS Disabled
    ```

1. Run the following command to configure the VM username using the correct [username requirements](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-username-requirements-when-creating-a-vm-). Replace `<MY-USER-NAME>` with the username.

    ```console
    azd env set AZURE_VM_USERNAME <MY-USER-NAME>
    ```

1. Run the following command to configure the VM password using the correct [password requirements](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/faq#what-are-the-password-requirements-when-creating-a-vm-). Replace `<MY-PASSWORD>` with the password.

    ```console
    azd env set AZURE_VM_PASSWORD <MY-PASSWORD>
    ```

1. Run the following command to create the VM and change the resource configuration. This command doesn't redeploy the application code because that code hasn't changed.

    ```console
    azd provision
    ```

## Use private chat app

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for your resource group. 
1. Select your resource group to see the resources within it. 
1. Find the VM resource and select it. 
1. Select **Connect -> Bastion**.

### Clean up GitHub Codespaces

#### [GitHub Codespaces](#tab/github-codespaces)

Deleting the GitHub Codespaces environment ensures that you can maximize the amount of free per-core hours entitlement you get for your account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information about your GitHub account's entitlements, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Sign into the GitHub Codespaces dashboard (<https://github.com/codespaces>).

1. Locate your currently running Codespaces sourced from the [`Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) GitHub repository.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/github-codespace-dashboard.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/github-codespace-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of all the running Codespaces including their status and templates.":::

1. Open the context menu for the Codespace and then select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/github-codespace-delete.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/github-codespace-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the context menu for a single codespace with the delete option highlighted.":::

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

You aren't necessarily required to clean up your local environment, but you can stop the running development container and return to running Visual Studio Code in the context of a local workspace.

1. Open the **Command Palette**, search for the **Dev Containers** commands, and then select **Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/reopen-local-command-palette.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-private-endpoints/reopen-local-command-palette.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Command Palette option to reopen the current folder within your local environment.":::

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio Code will stop the running development container, but the container still exists in Docker in a stopped state. You always have the option to deleting the container instance, container image, and volumes from Docker to free up more space on your local machine.
