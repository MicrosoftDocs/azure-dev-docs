# Authenticate to Azure resources from Python apps hosted on-premises

Apps hosted outside of Azure (for example on-premises or at a third-party data center) should use an application service principal to authenticate to Azure when accessing Azure resources. Application service principal objects are created using the app registration process in Azure. When an application service principal is created, a client ID and client secret will be generated for your app. The client ID, client secret, and your tenant ID are then stored in environment variables so they can be used by the Azure SDK for Python to authenticate your app to Azure at runtime.

A different app registration should be created for each environment the app is hosted in. This allows environment specific resource permissions to be configured for each service principal and ensures that an app deployed to one environment doesn't talk to Azure resources that are part of another environment.

## 1 - Register the application in Azure

An app can be registered with Azure using either the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <app-name>
```

The output of the command will be similar to the following. Make note of these values or keep this window open as you'll need these values in the next steps and won't be able to view the password (client secret) value again.

```json
{
  "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "displayName": "msdocs-python-sdk-auth-prod",
  "password": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
  "tenant": "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"
}
```

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and follow these steps.

## 2 - Assign roles to the application service principal

Next, you need to determine what roles (permissions) your app needs on what resources and assign those roles to your app. Roles can be assigned a role at a resource, resource group, or subscription scope. This example shows how to assign roles for the service principal at the resource group scope since most applications group all their Azure resources into a single resource group.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

A service principal is assigned a role in Azure using the [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) command.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee {appId} \
    --scope /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName} \
    --role "{roleName}" 
```

To get the role names that a service principal can be assigned to, use the [az role definition list](/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-list) command.

```azurecli
az role definition list \
    --query "sort_by([].{roleName:roleName, description:description}, &roleName)" \
    --output table
```

For example, to allow the service principal with the appId of `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` read, write, and delete access to Azure Storage blob containers and data in all storage accounts in the *msdocs-python-sdk-auth-example* resource group in the subscription with ID `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`, you would assign the application service principal to the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* role using the following command.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
    --scope /subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/resourceGroups/msdocs-python-sdk-auth-example \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
```

For information on assigning permissions at the resource or subscription level using the Azure CLI, see the article [Assign Azure roles using the Azure CLI](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli).

## 3 - Configure environment variables for application

You must set the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables for the process that runs your Python app to make the application service principal credentials available to your app at runtime. The [`DefaultAzureCredential`](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) object looks for the service principal information in these environment variables.

When using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) to run Python web apps in a UNIX server environment, environment variables for an app can be specified by using the `EnvironmentFile` directive in the `gunicorn.server` file as shown below.

```gunicorn.server
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
After=network.target  
  
[Service]  
User=www-user
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/python-app
EnvironmentFile=/path/to/python-app/py-env/app-environment-variables
ExecStart=/path/to/python-app/py-env/gunicorn --config config.py wsgi:app
            
[Install]  
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The file specified in the `EnvironmentFile` directive should contain a list of environment variables with their values as shown below.

```bash
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<value>
AZURE_TENANT_ID=<value>
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<value>
```

## 4 - Implement DefaultAzureCredential in application

To authenticate Azure SDK client objects to Azure, your application should use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class from the `azure.identity` package.

Start by adding the [azure.identity](https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/) package to your application.

```terminal
pip install azure-identity
```

Next, for any Python code that creates an Azure SDK client object in your app, you'll want to:

1. Import the `DefaultAzureCredential` class from the `azure.identity` module.
1. Create a `DefaultAzureCredential` object.
1. Pass the `DefaultAzureCredential` object to the Azure SDK client object constructor.

An example of this is shown in the following code segment.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Acquire a credential object
token_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(
        account_url="https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net",
        credential=token_credential)
```

When the above code instantiates the `DefaultAzureCredential` object, `DefaultAzureCredential` reads the environment variables `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` for the application service principal information to connect to Azure with.
