# Authenticate Python apps to Azure services during local development using developer accounts

When developers create cloud applications, they typically debug and test applications on their local workstation. When an application is run on a developer's workstation during local development, it still must authenticate to any Azure services used by the app. This article covers how to use a developer's Azure credentials to authenticate the app to Azure during local development.

:::image type="content" source="../media/local-dev-dev-accounts-overview.png" alt-text="A diagram showing how a Python app during local development uses the developers credentials to connect to Azure by obtaining those credentials from locally installed development tools.":::

For an app to authenticate to Azure during local development using the developer's Azure credentials, a developer must be signed-in to Azure from the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Developer CLI. The Azure SDK for Python is able to detect that the developer is signed-in from one of these tools and then obtain the necessary credentials from the credentials cache to authenticate the app to Azure as the signed-in user.

This approach is easiest to set up for a development team since it takes advantage of the developers' existing Azure accounts. However, a developer's account will likely have more permissions than required by the application, therefore exceeding the permissions the app will run with in production. As an alternative, you can [create application service principals to use during local development](./local-development-service-principal.md), which can be scoped to have only the access needed by the app.

## 1 - Create Microsoft Entra security group for local development

Since there are almost always multiple developers who work on an application, it's recommended to first create a Microsoft Entra security group to encapsulate the roles (permissions) the app needs in local development. This approach offers the following advantages.

- Every developer is assured to have the same roles assigned since roles are assigned at the group level.
- If a new role is needed for the app, it only needs to be added to the Microsoft Entra group for the app.
- If a new developer joins the team, they simply must be added to the correct Microsoft Entra group to get the correct permissions to work on the app.

If you have an existing Microsoft Entra security group for your development team, you can use that group. Otherwise, complete the following steps to create a Microsoft Entra security group.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The [az ad group create](/cli/azure/ad/group#az-ad-group-create) command is used to create groups in Microsoft Entra ID. The `--display-name` and `--main-nickname` parameters are required. The name given to the group should be based on the name of the application. It's also useful to include a phrase like 'local-dev' in the name of the group to indicate the purpose of the group.

```azurecli
az ad group create \
    --display-name MyDisplay \
    --mail-nickname MyDisplay  \
    --description "<group-description>"
```

Copy the value of the `id` property in the output of the command. This is the object ID for the group. You need it in later steps. You can also use the [az ad group show](/cli/azure/ad/group#az-ad-group-show) command to retrieve this property.

To add members to the group, you need the object ID of Azure user. Use the [az ad user list](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-user-list) to list the available service principals. The `--filter` parameter command accepts OData style filters and can be used to filter the list on the display name of the user as shown. The `--query` parameter limits the output to columns of interest.

```azurecli
az ad user list \
    --filter "startswith(displayName, 'Bob')" \
    --query "[].{objectId:id, displayName:displayName}" \
    --output table
```

The [az ad group member add](/cli/azure/ad/group/member#az-ad-group-member-add) command can then be used to add members to groups. 

```azurecli
az ad group member add \
    --group <group-name> \
    --member-id <object-id>
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the creation of Microsoft Entra security groups is limited to certain privileged roles in a directory. If you're unable to create a group, contact an administrator for your directory. If you're unable to add members to an existing group, contact the group owner or a directory administrator. To learn more, see [Manage Microsoft Entra groups and group membership](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups).

## 2 - Assign roles to the Microsoft Entra group

Next, you need to determine what roles (permissions) your app needs on what resources and assign those roles to your app. In this example, the roles will be assigned to the Microsoft Entra group created in step 1. Roles can be assigned at a resource, resource group, or subscription scope. This example shows how to assign roles at the resource group scope since most applications group all their Azure resources into a single resource group.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

A user, group, or application service principal is assigned a role in Azure using the [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment) command. You can specify a group with its object ID.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee {objectId} \
    --scope /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName} \
    --role "{roleName}" 
```

To get the role names that can be assigned, use the [az role definition list](/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-list) command.

```azurecli
az role definition list --query "sort_by([].{roleName:roleName, description:description}, &roleName)" --output table

```

For example, to allow the members of a group with an object ID of `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` read, write, and delete access to Azure Storage blob containers and data in all storage accounts in the *msdocs-python-sdk-auth-example* resource group in the subscription with ID `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`, you would assign the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* role to the group using the following command.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
    --scope /subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/resourceGroups/msdocs-python-sdk-auth-example \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
```

For information on assigning permissions at the resource or subscription level using the Azure CLI, see the article [Assign Azure roles using the Azure CLI](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli).

## 3 - Sign-in to Azure using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Developer CLI, or in a browser

### [Azure CLI](#tab/sign-in-azure-cli)

Open a terminal on your developer workstation and sign-in to Azure from the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli).

```azurecli
az login
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/sign-in-azure-powershell)

Open a terminal on your developer workstation and sign-in to Azure from [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/what-is-azure-powershell).

```azurepowershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/sign-in-azure-developer-cli)

Open a terminal on your developer workstation and sign-in to Azure from [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview).

```azdeveloper
azd auth login
```

### [Interactive browser](#tab/sign-in-interactive-browser)

Interactive authentication is disabled in the `DefaultAzureCredential` by default and can be enabled with a keyword argument:

```Python
DefaultAzureCredential(exclude_interactive_browser_credential=False)
```

---

## 4 - Implement DefaultAzureCredential in your application

To authenticate Azure SDK client objects to Azure, your application should use the [`DefaultAzureCredential`](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) class from the `azure.identity` package. In this scenario, `DefaultAzureCredential` will sequentially check to see if the developer has signed-in to Azure using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure developer CLI. If the developer is signed-in to Azure using any of these tools, then the credentials used to sign into the tool will be used by the app to authenticate to Azure.

Start by adding the [azure.identity](https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/) package to your application.

```terminal
pip install azure-identity
```

Next, for any Python code that creates an Azure SDK client object in your app, you'll want to:

1. Import the `DefaultAzureCredential` class from the `azure.identity` module.
1. Create a `DefaultAzureCredential` object.
1. Pass the `DefaultAzureCredential` object to the Azure SDK client object constructor.

An example of these steps is shown in the following code segment.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Acquire a credential object
token_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(
        account_url="https://<my_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net",
        credential=token_credential)
```
