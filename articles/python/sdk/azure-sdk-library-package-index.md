# Azure libraries package index

Azure Python SDK packages are published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), including beta releases marked with a "b" in the version number (such as 1.0.0b1). For the latest versions and release history, see the [Azure SDK Releases: Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_releases.html#python).

If you're looking for help with using a specific SDK package, you have several options:

* **Source code and samples**: In the Azure SDK for Python GitHub repository, each package has its own folder. To view its code, select the GitHub link in the "Source" column of the package index. Most repos include a README.md file with example usage.

* **API Reference documentation**: To view the API reference, select the Docs link in the same table. These pages provide an overview of the package, its classes, and their available methods.

* **Tutorials and developer guidance**: To explore tutorials, how-to guides, and installation instructions, Visit the [Azure for Python developers](index.yml) documentation. For example, to learn how to install SDK packages, see: [How to install Azure library packages for Python](./azure-sdk-install.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Name** column contains a friendly name for each package. To find the name you need to use to install the package with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), use the links in the **Package**, **Docs**, or **Source** columns. For example, the **Name** column for the Azure Blob Storage package is "Blobs" while the package name is *azure-storage-blob*.
>
> For Conda libraries, see the [Microsoft channel on anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/repo).
