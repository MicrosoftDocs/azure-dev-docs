# Quickstart: Scaling services deployed with the azd Python web templates using Bicep

The [Python web `azd` templates](./overview-azd-templates.md) allow you to quickly create a new web application and deploy it to Azure. The `azd` templates were designed to use low-cost Azure service options. Undoubtedly, you'll want to adjust the service levels (or skus) for each of the services defined in the template for your scenario.

In this Quickstart, you'll update the appropriate bicep template files to scale up existing services and add new services to your deployment. Then, you'll run the `azd provision` command and view the change you made to the Azure deployment.

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true)

You must have the following installed on your local computer:

- [Azure Developer CLI](../azure-developer-cli/install-azd.md?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Container Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [Visual Studio Code Bicep](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep) This extension helps you author Bicep syntax.

## Deploy a template

To begin, you need a working `azd` deployment. Once you have that in place, you're able to modify the Bicep files generated by the `azd` template.

1. Follow steps 1 through 7 in the [Quickstart article](./quickstart-python-web-azd-templates.md). In step 2, use the `azure-django-postgres-flexible-appservice` template. For your convenience, here's the entire sequence of commands to issue from the command line:

   ```shell
   mkdir azdtest
   cd azdtest
   azd init --template azure-django-postgres-flexible-appservice
   azd auth login
   azd up
   ```

   Once `azd up` finishes, open the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure App Service that was deployed in your new Resource Group and take note of the App Service pricing plan (see the App Service plan's Overview page, Essentials section, "Pricing plan" value).

2. In step 1 of the Quickstart article, you were instructed to create the *azdtest* folder. Open that folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. In the Explorer pane, navigate to the *infra* folder. Observe the subfolders and files in the *infra* folder.

   The *main.bicep* file orchestrates the creation of all the services deployed when performing an `azd up` or `azd provision`. It calls into other files, like *db.bicep* and *web.bicep*, which in turn call into files contained in the *\core* subfolder.

   The *\core* subfolder is a deeply nested folder structure containing bicep templates for many Azure services. Some of the files in the *\core* subfolder are referenced by the three top level bicep files (*main.bicep*, *db.bicep* and *web.bicep*) and some aren't used at all in this project.

## Scale a service by modifying its Bicep properties

You can scale an existing resource in your deployment by changing its SKU. To demonstrate this, you'll change the App Service plan from the "Basic Service plan" (which is designed for apps with lower traffic requirements and don’t need advanced auto scale and traffic management features) to the "Standard Service plan", which is designed for running production workloads.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all SKU changes can be made after the fact. Some research may be necessary to better understand your scaling options.

1. Open the *web.bicep* file and locate the `appService` module definition. In particular, look for the property setting:

   ```bicep
      sku: {
         name: 'B1'
      }
   ```

   Change the value from `B1` to `S1` as follows:

   ```bicep
      sku: {
         name: 'S1'
      }
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > As a result of this change, the price per hour will increase slightly. Details about the different service plans and their associated costs can be found on the [App Service pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/windows/).

2. Assuming you already have the application deployed in Azure, use the following command to deploy changes to the infrastructure while not redeploying the application code itself.

   ```shell
   azd provision
   ```

   You shouldn't be prompted for a location and subscription. Those values are saved in the *.azure\<environment-name>\.env* file where `<environment-name>` is the environment name you provided during `azd init`.

3. When `azd provision` is complete, confirm your web application still works. Also find the App Service Plan for your Resource Group and confirm that the Pricing Plan is set to the Standard Service Plan (S1).

## Add a new service definition with Bicep

You can add a new resource to your deployment by making larger changes to the Bicep in the project. To demonstrate this, you'll add an instance of Azure Cache for Redis to your existing deployment in preparation for a fictitious new feature you plan to add at some future date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As a result of this change, you will be paying for an instance of Azure Cache for Redis until you delete the resource in the Azure portal or using `azd down`. Details about the different service plans and their associated costs can be found on the [Azure Cache for Redis pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cache/).

1. Create a new file in the *infra* folder named *redis.bicep*. Copy and paste the following code into the new file:

   ```python
   param name string
   param location string = resourceGroup().location
   param tags object = {}
   param keyVaultName string
   param connStrKeyName string
   param passwordKeyName string
   param primaryKeyKeyName string

   @allowed([
     'Enabled'
     'Disabled'
   ])
   param publicNetworkAccess string = 'Enabled'

   @allowed([
     'C'
     'P'
   ])
   param skuFamily string = 'C'

   @allowed([
     0
     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
   ])
   param skuCapacity int = 1
   @allowed([
     'Basic'
     'Standard'
     'Premium'
   ])
   param skuName string = 'Standard'

   param saveKeysToVault bool = true

   resource redis 'Microsoft.Cache/redis@2020-12-01' = {
     name: name
     location: location
     properties: {
       sku: {
         capacity: skuCapacity
         family: skuFamily
         name: skuName
       }
       publicNetworkAccess: publicNetworkAccess
       enableNonSslPort: true    
     }
     tags: tags
   }

   resource keyVault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2022-07-01' existing = {
     name: keyVaultName
   }

   resource redisKey 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2022-07-01' = if (saveKeysToVault) {
     name: primaryKeyKeyName
     parent: keyVault
     properties: {
       value: redis.listKeys().primaryKey
     }
   }
 
   resource redisConnStr 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2018-02-14' = if (saveKeysToVault) {
     name: connStrKeyName
     parent: keyVault
     properties: {
       value: '${name}.redis.cache.windows.net,abortConnect=false,ssl=true,password=${redis.listKeys().primaryKey}'
     }
   }
   resource redisPassword 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2018-02-14' = if (saveKeysToVault) {
     name: passwordKeyName
     parent: keyVault
     properties: {
       value: redis.listKeys().primaryKey
     }
   }

   output REDIS_ID string = redis.id
   output REDIS_HOST string = redis.properties.hostName
   ```

2. Modify the *main.bicep* file to create an instance of the "redis" resource.

   In the *main.bicep* file, add the following code below the ending curly braces associated with the *Web frontend* section and above the *secrets* section.

   ```python
   // Caching server
   module redis 'redis.bicep' = {
     name: 'redis'
     scope: resourceGroup
     params: {
       name: replace('${take(prefix, 19)}-rds', '--', '-')
       location: location
       tags: tags
       keyVaultName: keyVault.outputs.name
       connStrKeyName: 'RedisConnectionString'
       passwordKeyName: 'RedisPassword'
       primaryKeyKeyName: 'RedisPrimaryKey'
       publicNetworkAccess: 'Enabled'
       skuFamily: 'C'
       skuCapacity: 1
       skuName: 'Standard'
       saveKeysToVault: true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Add output values to the bottom of the file:

   ```python
   output REDIS_ID string = redis.outputs.REDIS_ID
   output REDIS_HOST string = redis.outputs.REDIS_HOST
   ```

4. Confirm that the entire *main.bicep* file is identical to the following code:

   ```python
   targetScope = 'subscription'

   @minLength(1)
   @maxLength(64)
   @description('Name which is used to generate a short unique hash for each resource')
   param name string

   @minLength(1)
   @description('Primary location for all resources')
   param location string

   @secure()
   @description('DBServer administrator password')
   param dbserverPassword string

   @secure()
   @description('Secret Key')
   param secretKey string

   @description('Id of the user or app to assign application roles')
   param principalId string = ''

   var resourceToken = toLower(uniqueString(subscription().id, name, location))
   var prefix = '${name}-${resourceToken}'
   var tags = { 'azd-env-name': name }

   resource resourceGroup 'Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2021-04-01' = {
     name: '${name}-rg'
     location: location
     tags: tags
   }

   // Store secrets in a keyvault
   module keyVault './core/security/keyvault.bicep' = {
     name: 'keyvault'
     scope: resourceGroup
     params: {
       name: '${take(replace(prefix, '-', ''), 17)}-vault'
       location: location
       tags: tags
       principalId: principalId
     }
   }

   module db 'db.bicep' = {
     name: 'db'
     scope: resourceGroup
     params: {
       name: 'dbserver'
       location: location
       tags: tags
       prefix: prefix
       dbserverDatabaseName: 'relecloud'
       dbserverPassword: dbserverPassword
     }
   }

   // Monitor application with Azure Monitor
   module monitoring 'core/monitor/monitoring.bicep' = {
     name: 'monitoring'
     scope: resourceGroup
     params: {
       location: location
       tags: tags
       applicationInsightsDashboardName: '${prefix}-appinsights-dashboard'
       applicationInsightsName: '${prefix}-appinsights'
       logAnalyticsName: '${take(prefix, 50)}-loganalytics' // Max 63 chars
     }
   }

   // Web frontend
   module web 'web.bicep' = {
     name: 'web'
     scope: resourceGroup
     params: {
       name: replace('${take(prefix, 19)}-appsvc', '--', '-')
       location: location
       tags: tags
       applicationInsightsName: monitoring.outputs.applicationInsightsName
       keyVaultName: keyVault.outputs.name
       appCommandLine: 'entrypoint.sh'
       pythonVersion: '3.12'
       dbserverDomainName: db.outputs.dbserverDomainName
       dbserverUser: db.outputs.dbserverUser
       dbserverDatabaseName: db.outputs.dbserverDatabaseName
     }
   }

   // Caching server
   module redis 'redis.bicep' = {
     name: 'redis'
     scope: resourceGroup
     params: {
       name: replace('${take(prefix, 19)}-rds', '--', '-')
       location: location
       tags: tags
       keyVaultName: keyVault.outputs.name
       connStrKeyName: 'RedisConnectionString'
       passwordKeyName: 'RedisPassword'
       primaryKeyKeyName: 'RedisPrimaryKey'
       publicNetworkAccess: 'Enabled'
       skuFamily: 'C'
       skuCapacity: 1
       skuName: 'Standard'
       saveKeysToVault: true
     }
   }

   var secrets = [
     {
       name: 'DBSERVERPASSWORD'
       value: dbserverPassword
     }
     {
       name: 'SECRETKEY'
       value: secretKey
     }
   ]

   @batchSize(1)
   module keyVaultSecrets './core/security/keyvault-secret.bicep' = [for secret in secrets: {
     name: 'keyvault-secret-${secret.name}'
     scope: resourceGroup
     params: {
       keyVaultName: keyVault.outputs.name
       name: secret.name
       secretValue: secret.value
     }
   }]

   output AZURE_LOCATION string = location
   output AZURE_KEY_VAULT_ENDPOINT string = keyVault.outputs.endpoint
   output AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME string = keyVault.outputs.name
   output APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_NAME string = monitoring.outputs.applicationInsightsName
   output BACKEND_URI string = web.outputs.uri

   output REDIS_ID string = redis.outputs.REDIS_ID
   output REDIS_HOST string = redis.outputs.REDIS_HOST
   ```

5. Make sure all your changes are saved, then use the following command to update your provisioned resources on Azure:

   ```shell
   azd provision
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Depending on many factors, adding an instance of Azure Cache for Redis to the existing deployment could take a long time. In testing, we experienced execution times in excess of 20 minutes. As long as you do not see any errors, allow the process to continue until complete.

6. When `azd provision` completes, open the Azure portal, navigate to the Resource Group for your deployment, and in the list of services confirm you now have an instance of Azure Cache for Redis.

This concludes the Quickstart, however there are many Azure services that can help you build more scalable and production-ready applications. A great place to start would be to learn about [Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts), [Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview), [Azure CDN](/azure/cdn/cdn-overview), and [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview), to name a few.

## Clean up resources

Clean up the resources created by the template by running the [azd down](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference#azd-down) command.

```shell
azd down
```

The `azd down` command deletes the Azure resources and the GitHub Actions workflow. When prompted, agree to deleting all resources associated with the resource group.

You can also delete the *azdtest* folder, or use it as the basis for your own application by modifying the files of the project.
