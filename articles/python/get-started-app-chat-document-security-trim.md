# Get started with chat document security for Python

When you build a [chat application by using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern](get-started-app-chat-template.md) with your own data, make sure that each user receives an answer based on their permissions. Follow the process in this article to add document access control to your chat app.

- **Authorized user**: This person should have access to answers contained within the documents of the chat app.

- **Unauthorized user**: This person shouldn't have access to answers from secured documents they don't have authorization to see.

   :::image type="content" source="media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/chat-answer-with-no-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the chat app with an answer that indicates the user doesn't have access to data.":::

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses one or more [AI app templates](../ai/intelligent-app-templates.md) as the basis for the examples and guidance in the article. AI app templates provide you with well-maintained reference implementations that are easy to deploy. They help to ensure a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

## Architectural overview

Without a document security feature, the enterprise chat app has a simple architecture by using Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI. An answer is determined from queries to Azure AI Search where the documents are stored, in combination with a response from an Azure OpenAI GPT model. No user authentication is used in this simple flow.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/simple-rag-chat-architecture.png" alt-text="Architectural diagram that shows how Azure AI Search finds answers from stored documents and combines them with a response from Azure OpenAI.":::

To add security for the documents, you need to update the enterprise chat app:

- Add client authentication to the chat app with Microsoft Entra.
- Add server-side logic to populate a search index with user and group access.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/trimmed-rag-chat-architecture.png" alt-text="Architectural diagram that shows a user authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID, and then passing that authentication to Azure AI Search.":::

Azure AI Search doesn't provide _native_ document-level permissions and can't vary search results from within an index by user permissions. Instead, your application can use search filters to ensure that a document is accessible to a specific user or by a specific group. Within your search index, each document should have a filterable field that stores user or group identity information.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/azure-ai-search-with-user-authorization.png" alt-text="Architectural diagram showing that each document in Azure AI Search has user authentication, which appears in the search results.":::

Because the authorization isn't natively contained in Azure AI Search, you need to add a field to hold user or group information, and then [filter](/azure/search/search-security-trimming-for-azure-search) any documents that don't match. To implement this technique, you need to:

* Create a document access control field in your index dedicated to storing the details of users or groups with document access.
* Populate the document's access control field with the relevant user or group details.
* Update this access control field whenever there are changes in user or group access permissions.

If your index updates are scheduled with an indexer, changes are picked up on the next indexer run. If you don't use an indexer, you need to manually reindex.

In this article, the process of securing documents in Azure AI Search is made possible with _example_ scripts, which you as the search administrator would run. The scripts associate a single document with a single user identity. You can take these [scripts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/tree/main/scripts) and apply your own security and production requirements to scale to your needs.

## Determine security configuration

The solution provides Boolean environment variables to turn on features that are necessary for document security in this sample.

|Parameter|Purpose|
|--|--|
|`AZURE_USE_AUTHENTICATION`|When set to `true`, enables user sign-in to the chat app and Azure App Service authentication. Enables `Use oid security filter` in the chat app **Developer settings**.|
|`AZURE_ENFORCE_ACCESS_CONTROL`|When set to `true`, requires authentication for any document access. The **Developer settings** for object ID (OID) and group security are turned on and disabled so that they can't be disabled from the UI.|
|`AZURE_ENABLE_GLOBAL_DOCUMENTS_ACCESS`|When set to `true`, this setting allows authenticated users to search on documents that have no access controls assigned, even when access control is required. This parameter should be used only when `AZURE_ENFORCE_ACCESS_CONTROL` is enabled.|
|`AZURE_ENABLE_UNAUTHENTICATED_ACCESS`|When set to `true`, this setting allows unauthenticated users to use the app, even when access control is enforced. This parameter should be used only when `AZURE_ENFORCE_ACCESS_CONTROL` is enabled.|

Use the following sections to understand the security profiles supported in this sample. This article configures the *Enterprise profile*.

### Enterprise: Required account + document filter

Each user of the site _must_ sign in. The site contains content that's public to all users. The document-level security filter is applied to all requests.

Environment variables:

- `AZURE_USE_AUTHENTICATION=true`
- `AZURE_ENABLE_GLOBAL_DOCUMENTS_ACCESS=true`
- `AZURE_ENFORCE_ACCESS_CONTROL=true`

### Mixed use: Optional account + document filter

Each user of the site _might_ sign in. The site contains content that's public to all users. The document-level security filter is applied to all requests.

Environment variables:

- `AZURE_USE_AUTHENTICATION=true`
- `AZURE_ENABLE_GLOBAL_DOCUMENTS_ACCESS=true`
- `AZURE_ENFORCE_ACCESS_CONTROL=true`
- `AZURE_ENABLE_UNAUTHENTICATED_ACCESS=true`

## Open a development environment

Use the following instructions to deploy a preconfigured development environment containing all required dependencies to complete this article.

#### [GitHub Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces) runs a development container managed by GitHub with [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) as the user interface. For the most straightforward development environment, use GitHub Codespaces so that you have the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use GitHub Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with two core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Start the process to create a new GitHub codespace on the `main` branch of the [Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) GitHub repository.
1. Right-click the following button, and select **Open link in new windows** to have the development environment and the documentation available at the same time.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces.](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)

1. On the **Create codespace** page, review the codespace configuration settings, then select **Create new codespace**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/github-create-codespace.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the confirmation screen before you create a new codespace.":::

1. Wait for the codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.

1. In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Complete the authentication process.

1. The remaining tasks in this article take place in the context of this development container.

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to be installed on your local machine. The extension hosts the development container locally by using the Docker host with the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

1. Create a new local directory on your computer for the project.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-intelligent-app && cd my-intelligent-app
    ```

1. Open Visual Studio Code in that directory.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
1. Run the following `AZD` command to bring the GitHub repository to your local computer.

    ```bash
    azd init -t azure-search-openai-demo
    ```

1. Open the **Command** palette, and search for and select **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container** to open the project in a dev container. Wait until the dev container opens before you continue.
1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```
    Copy the code from the terminal and then paste it into a browser. Follow the instructions to authenticate with your Azure account.
1. The remaining exercises in this project take place in the context of this development container.

## Get required information with the Azure CLI

Get your subscription ID and tenant ID with the following Azure CLI command. Copy the value to use as your `AZURE_TENANT_ID` value.

```azurecli
az account list --query "[].{subscription_id:id, name:name, tenantId:tenantId}" -o table
```

If you get an error about your tenant's conditional access policy, you need a second tenant without a conditional access policy.

* Your first tenant, associated with your user account, is used for the `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
* Your second tenant, without conditional access, is used for the `AZURE_AUTH_TENANT_ID` environment variable to access Microsoft Graph. For tenants with a conditional access policy, find the ID of a second tenant without a conditional access policy or [create a new tenant](/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant).

## Set environment variables

1. Run the following commands to configure the application for the **Enterprise** profile.

    ```console
    azd env set AZURE_USE_AUTHENTICATION true
    azd env set AZURE_ENABLE_GLOBAL_DOCUMENTS_ACCESS true
    azd env set AZURE_ENFORCE_ACCESS_CONTROL true
    ```

1. Run the following command to set the tenant, which authorizes the user sign-in to the hosted application environment. Replace `<YOUR_TENANT_ID>` with the tenant ID.

    ```console
    azd env set AZURE_TENANT_ID <YOUR_TENANT_ID>
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a conditional access policy on your user tenant, you need to [specify an authentication tenant](#provide-authentication-tenant).

## Deploy the chat app to Azure

Deployment consists of the following steps:

- Create the Azure resources.
- Upload the documents.
- Create the Microsoft Entra identity apps (client and server).
- Turn on identity for the hosting resource.

1. Provision the Azure resources and deploy the source code.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```

1. Use the following table to answer the `AZD` deployment prompts.

    |Prompt|Answer|
    |--|--|
    |Environment name| Use a short name with identifying information such as your alias and app. And example is `tjones-secure-chat`.|
    |Subscription|Select a subscription in which to create the resources.|
    |Location for Azure resources|Select a location near you. |
    |Location for `documentIntelligentResourceGroupLocation`|Select a location near you.|
    |Location for `openAIResourceGroupLocation`|Select a location near you. |

    Wait 5 or 10 minutes after the app deploys to allow the app to start up.
1. After the application successfully deploys, a URL appears in the terminal.
1. Select the URL labeled `(âœ“) Done: Deploying service webapp` to open the chat application in a browser.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/azd-deployment-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the chat app in a browser with chat suggestions and the chat text box.":::

1. Agree to the app authentication pop-up.
1. When the chat app appears, notice in the upper-right corner that your user is signed in.
1. Open **Developer settings** and notice that both of the following options are selected and disabled for change:

    * **Use oid security filter**
    * **Use groups security filter**

1. Select the card with **What does a product manager do?**.
1. You get an answer like: **The provided sources do not contain specific information about the role of a Product Manager at Contoso Electronics.**

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/role-library-access-denied.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a chat app in a browser showing that the answer can't be returned.":::

## Open access to a document for a user

Turn on your permissions for the exact document so that you _can_ get the answer. You need several pieces of information:

* Azure Storage
    * Account name
    * Container name
    * Blob/document URL for `role_library.pdf`
* User's ID in Microsoft Entra ID

When this information is known, update the Azure AI Search index `oids` field for the `role_library.pdf` document.

### Get the URL for a document in storage

1. In the `.azure` folder at the root of the project, find the environment directory, and open the `.env` file with that directory.
1. Search for the `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` entry and copy its value.
1. Use the following Azure CLI commands to get the URL of the `role_library.pdf` blob in the `content` container.

    ```azurecli
    az storage blob url \
        --account-name <REPLACE_WITH_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT \
        --container-name 'content' \
        --name 'role_library.pdf' 
    ```
    
    |Parameter|Purpose|
    |--|--|
    |--account-name|Azure Storage account name.|
    |--container-name|The container name in this sample is `content`.|
    |--name|The blob name in this step is `role_library.pdf`. |

1. Copy the blob URL to use later.

### Get your user ID

1. In the chat app, select **Developer settings**.
1. In the **ID Token claims** section, copy your `objectidentifier` parameter. This parameter is known in the next section as `USER_OBJECT_ID`.

### Provide user access to a document in Azure Search

1. Use the following script to change the `oids` field in Azure AI Search for `role_library.pdf` so that you have access to it.

    ```python
    python ./scripts/manageacl.py --acl-type oids --acl-action add --acl <REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_USER_OBJECT_ID> --url <REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOCUMENT_URL>
    ```
    
    |Parameter|Purpose|
    |--|--|
    |-v|Verbose output.|
    |--acl-type|Group or user OIDs: `oids`.|
    |--acl-action|**Add** to a Search index field. Other options include `enable_acls`, `remove`, `remove_all`, and `view`. |
    |--acl|Group or user `USER_OBJECT_ID`.|
    |--url|The file's location in Azure Storage, such as `https://MYSTORAGENAME.blob.core.windows.net/content/role_library.pdf`. Don't surround the URL with quotation marks in the CLI command.|

1. The console output for this command looks like:

    ```console.
    Loading azd .env file from current environment...
    Creating Python virtual environment "app/backend/.venv"...
    Installing dependencies from "requirements.txt" into virtual environment (in quiet mode)...
    Running manageacl.py. Arguments to script: -v --acl-type oids --acl-action add --acl 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --url https://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/content/role_library.pdf
    Found 58 search documents with storageUrl https://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/content/role_library.pdf
    Adding acl 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 to 58 search documents
    ```

1. Optionally, use the following command to verify that your permission is listed for the file in Azure AI Search.

    ```python
    python ./scripts/manageacl.py -v --acl-type groups --acl-action view --url <REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOCUMENT_URL>
    ```

    |Parameter|Purpose|
    |--|--|
    |-v|Verbose output.|
    |--acl-type|Group or user OIDs: `oids`.|
    |--acl-action|View a Search index field `oids`. Other options include `enable_acls`, `remove`, `remove_all`, and `add`. |
    |--url|The file's location in that shows, such as `https://MYSTORAGENAME.blob.core.windows.net/content/role_library.pdf`. Don't surround the URL with quotation marks in the CLI command.|

1. The console output for this command looks like:

    ```console.
    Loading azd .env file from current environment...
    Creating Python virtual environment "app/backend/.venv"...
    Installing dependencies from "requirements.txt" into virtual environment (in quiet mode)...
    Running manageacl.py. Arguments to script: -v --acl-type oids --acl-action view --acl 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --url https://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/content/role_library.pdf
    Found 58 search documents with storageUrl https://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/content/role_library.pdf
    [00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000]
    ```

    The array at the end of the output includes your `USER_OBJECT_ID` parameter and is used to determine if the document is used in the answer with Azure OpenAI.

### Verify that Azure AI Search contains your USER_OBJECT_ID

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for `AI Search`.
1. Select your search resource from the list.
1. Select **Search management** > **Indexes**.
1. Select **gptkbindex**.
1. Select **View** > **JSON view**.
1. Replace the JSON with the following JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "search": "*",
      "select": "sourcefile, oids",
      "filter": "oids/any()"
    }
    ```

    This JSON searches all documents where the `oids` field has any value and returns the `sourcefile` and `oids` fields.

1. If the `role_library.pdf` doesn't have your OID, return to the [Provide user access to a document in Azure Search](#provide-user-access-to-a-document-in-azure-search) section and complete the steps.

### Verify user access to the document

If you completed the steps but didn't see the correct answer, verify that your `USER_OBJECT_ID` parameter is set correctly in Azure AI Search for `role_library.pdf`.

1. Return to the chat app. You might need to sign in again.
1. Enter the same query so that the `role_library` content is used in the Azure OpenAI answer: `What does a product manager do?`.
1. View the result, which now includes the appropriate answer from the role library document.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/role-library-access-granted.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a chat app in a browser showing that the answer is returned.":::

## Clean up resources

The following steps walk you through the process of cleaning up the resources you used.

### Clean up Azure resources

The Azure resources created in this article are billed to your Azure subscription. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete them to avoid incurring more charges.

Run the following Azure Developer CLI command to delete the Azure resources and remove the source code.

```bash
azd down --purge
```

### Clean up GitHub Codespaces and Visual Studio Code

The following steps walk you through the process of cleaning up the resources you used.

#### [GitHub Codespaces](#tab/github-codespaces)

Deleting the GitHub Codespaces environment ensures that you can maximize the amount of free per-core hours entitlement that you get for your account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information about your GitHub account's entitlements, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Sign in to the [GitHub Codespaces dashboard](https://github.com/codespaces).

1. Locate your currently running codespaces that are sourced from the [Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) GitHub repository.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/github-codespace-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows all the running codespaces including their status and templates.":::

1. Open the context menu for the codespace and then select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/github-codespace-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the context menu for a single codespace with the Delete option highlighted.":::

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

You aren't necessarily required to clean up your local environment, but you can stop the running development container and return to running Visual Studio Code in the context of a local workspace.

1. Open the **Command** palette and search for the **Dev Containers** commands.
1. Select **Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-document-security-trim/reopen-local-command-palette.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Command palette option to reopen the current folder within your local environment.":::

> [!TIP]
> After Visual Studio Code stops the running development container, the container still exists in Docker in a stopped state. You can delete the container instance, container image, and volumes from Docker to free up more space on your local machine.
