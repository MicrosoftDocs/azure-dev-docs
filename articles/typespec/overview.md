# What is TypeSpec?

[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/) is a powerful and flexible language for designing APIs. It allows developers to define APIs in an extensible and easy-to-understand language. That compilation uses emitters to generate API specifications, client code, and server-side API code. TypeSpec is an [open source project](#open-source-support) developed by Microsoft and supported by the community.

TypeSpec enables you to create modular, reusable components which are concise and compliant with API guidelines. The standard TypeSpec library includes an OpenAPI emitter, ensuring compatibility with existing tools and workflows.

As an open source language, TypeSpec can describe any API, not just Azure APIs. This versatility makes it a valuable tool for API developers, architects, and managers who need to deliver high-quality APIs in a complex and evolving environment.

## Benefits of TypeSpec

* **Simplifies API Development**: Provides a clear and concise way to define APIs, allowing developers to focus on logic and functionality.
* **Accelerates Deployment**: TypeSpec enables rapid service and client code generation from a single API definition, streamlining deployment and ensuring consistency.
* **Ensures Compliance**: Uses reusable components to adhere to established guidelines and standards, reducing errors and inconsistencies.
* **Enhances Compatibility**: Includes an OpenAPI emitter for compatibility with existing tools and workflows, making integration easier.
* **Supports Extensibility**: Flexible and extensible, allowing customization and extension of API definitions for various scenarios.
* **Accelerates Migration**: [OpenApiMigration tool](https://typespec.io/docs/emitters/openapi3/cli/#converting-openapi-3-into-typespec) eases transition to TypeSpec for faster adoption.

As an [open-source project](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/), TypeSpec benefits from community contributions and feedback, ensuring continuous improvement based on real-world use cases.

## API design is challenging

TypeSpec addresses common challenges in API design, governance, and implementation:

- **Complex Specifications**: Writing, reviewing, and maintaining API specifications can be cumbersome. Even a simple API can result in hundreds of lines of specification code.
- **Protocol Diversity**: Each protocol has its own specification format, with no shared design language across protocols. This fragmentation complicates the development process.
- **Governance Issues**: Without a unified design language, governing APIs becomes difficult, leading to inconsistencies in implementation and quality.
- **Scalability Concerns**: As the number of APIs or API versions increases, more engineering teams are required, which can lead to coordination challenges and inefficiencies.

By addressing these challenges, TypeSpec simplifies the API design process, ensures consistency across different protocols, and enhances overall governance and scalability.

## TypeSpec API development workflow

The following diagram illustrates the key stages involved in developing APIs with TypeSpec. The process starts with two options: creating a new API specification from scratch or migrating from an existing OpenAPI spec. Once you begin, the API is defined using TypeSpec, using its modular and reusable components. The TypeSpec compiler then processes these definitions, using a robust set of emitters to automatically generate API specifications, client code, and server-side stub code. Finally, the generated artifacts are integrated with existing toolchains, ensuring a smooth and consistent workflow.

**Workflow Steps**

| Step                     | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Start**                | Begin by writing a new API specification using TypeSpec or migrating from an existing OpenAPI spec.      |
| **TypeSpec Definition**  | Define the API using TypeSpec. Reusable components make the API concise and ensure compliance with guidelines. |
| **TypeSpec Compiler**    | The compiler processes the TypeSpec definitions to prepare them for code generation.                    |
| **Generation**           | Dedicated emitters automatically generate the API specification, client code, and server-side stub code. |
| **Integration**          | The generated outputs are seamlessly integrated into existing API toolchains.                           |

**Paths from the TypeSpec Compiler:**  
The TypeSpec compiler can generate outputs for OpenAPI specifications, client code, and server-side stub code concurrently if needed, while still allowing you to trigger each output independently based on your project requirements.

1. **Generate OpenAPI Specifications**  
   *The OpenAPI emitter produces a standardized API description format.*

2. **Generate Client-Side Code**  
   *The client code emitter creates code for consuming the API.*

3. **Generate Server-Side Stub Code**  
   *The service-side emitter generates server stub code to kickstart API implementation.*

## Comprehensive code generation with TypeSpec

### Client code generation

TypeSpec streamlines client code generation by automatically creating code to consume APIs directly from TypeSpec definitions. This process leverages key capabilities such as standard runtime interfaces that ensure seamless integration, custom code extensibility to tailor the output for specific client needs, and comprehensive generation that spans the entire development stack. As a result, developers can maintain consistency across applications, reduce manual coding effort, and quickly integrate APIs with existing toolchains while enjoying a more efficient and scalable development workflow.

Languages supported:

* .NET
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python

### Server code generation

TypeSpec supports generating server-side stub code directly from TypeSpec definitions. This streamlines the development process and ensures consistency across client and server implementations.

Languages supported:

* .NET
* JavaScript

Key capabilities:

* **Standard Runtime Interfaces**: The standard emitter focuses on generating runtime interfaces initially, ensuring flexibility and easy integration with various runtime stacks.
* **Custom Code Extensibility**: TypeSpec emitters offer custom code extensibility, allowing developers to tailor the generated code to specific needs, making it adaptable to different environments.
* **Comprehensive Code Generation**: TypeSpec supports code generation across the entire development stack, from clients to servers, including different protocols and asset types, ensuring a unified development approach.

By using TypeSpecâ€™s service-side code generation capabilities, developers can reduce manual coding, improve consistency, and enhance overall productivity.

## Interoperability with industry toolchain

TypeSpec seamlessly integrates with existing industry toolchains, ensuring interoperability, and enhancing productivity. By generating OpenAPI specifications from TypeSpec definitions, developers can use a vast ecosystem of tools designed for OpenAPI, such as Swagger for API documentation, Postman for API testing, and Azure API Management for deploying APIs. This includes configuring API gateways, generating client and server code, and validating API data. This compatibility allows teams to maintain their current workflows while benefiting from the structured and consistent API design that TypeSpec provides.
