[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) is a cloud-native infrastructure as code (IaC) platform that allows developers to use familiar programming languages to define and manage infrastructure resources across multiple cloud and on-premises providers. With Pulumi, you can define infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, databases, and networking components using code, which makes it easy to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure. This helps developers to be more productive, and it also enables organizations to adopt a more agile and efficient approach to infrastructure management. Pulumi supports a wide range of programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, and Go. Pulumi integrates seamlessly with Azure and also has support for a wide range of public clouds, private clouds, and SaaS services.
