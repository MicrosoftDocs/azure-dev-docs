# Install or update the Azure Developer CLI

Welcome to the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)! Let's get started with installing and learning how to run `azd`.

Start by selecting your development environment. For more information about the pros and cons of the different development environment choices, see [Azure Developer CLI (azd) supported environments](./supported-languages-environments.md#supported-development-environments).

For more advanced installation scenarios and instructions, see [Azure Developer CLI Installer Scripts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/main/cli/installer/README.md#advanced-installation-scenarios).

Note: When you install `azd`, the following tools are installed within `azd` scope (meaning they aren't installed globally) and are removed if azd is uninstalled:

- The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- The [Bicep CLI](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)

### [Windows Package Manager (winget)](#tab/winget-windows)
### Install `azd`

```powershell
winget install microsoft.azd
```

### Update `azd`

```powershell
winget upgrade microsoft.azd
```

### Uninstall `azd`

### [Script](#tab/script-windows)

### Install `azd`

The install script downloads and installs the MSI package on the machine with default parameters.

```powershell
powershell -ex AllSigned -c "Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"
```

### Update `azd`

```powershell
powershell -ex AllSigned -c "Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"
```

### Uninstall `azd`

Using the uninstall script to remove `azd` leaves some items behind on the machine. **Instead, for version 0.5.0-beta.1 and later:** 

1. Search for **Add or remove programs** in Windows.

2. Locate **Azure Dev CLI** and select the three dots to expand the options menu.

3. Select **Uninstall**.

### [Arm64](#tab/arm64)

> [!NOTE]
> Support for Windows Arm64 is currently in Alpha. Visit the [Feature versioning and release strategy](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/feature-versioning) page for more information.

The Arm64 version of `azd` is available to download directly on the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases). Currently, there is no direct support for package manager installers or other channels.

### Install `azd`

> [!NOTE]
> If your machine already has the Windows x86_64 version of `azd` installed, first uninstall the x86_64 version to prevent MSI upgrades or repairs from writing over the Arm64 executable.

1. On the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases) page, download the latest `azd-windows-arm64-alpha.zip` file.

1. Extract the `azd-windows-arm64-alpha.zip` file and copy the `azd-windows-amd64.exe` executable to the default `azd` location `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Azure Dev CLI` on your device.

1. Add an entry to the `PATH` environment variable on your device to point to the extracted file at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Azure Dev CLI\azd-windows-amd64.exe`.

### Update `azd`

1. On the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases) page, download the latest `azd-windows-arm64-alpha.zip` file.

1. Extract the `azd-windows-arm64-alpha.zip` file and copy the `azd-windows-amd64.exe` executable to the default `azd` location `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Azure Dev CLI` on your device to replace the existing executable.

1. Verify you have a `PATH` environment variable on your device that points to the extracted file at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Azure Dev CLI\azd-windows-amd64.exe`.

### Uninstall `azd`

1. Remove the `azd-windows-amd64.exe` executable from the default `azd` location `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Azure Dev CLI` on your device. If you installed `azd` in a different location, you'll need to delete it from there.

1. Remove the `PATH` environment variable you added to point to the `azd` install location.

### [Homebrew (recommended)](#tab/brew-mac)

> [!NOTE] 
> On Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and M2) `azd` requires Rosetta 2. If Rosetta 2 is not already installed run `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` from the terminal.
>
> The `azd` install process will automatically choose the correct binary for the architecture of your machine.

### Install `azd`

```bash
brew tap azure/azd && brew install azd
```

The `brew tap azure/azd` command only needs to be run once to configure the tap in `brew`.

If you're using `brew` to upgrade `azd` from a version not installed using `brew`, remove the existing version of `azd` using the uninstall script (if installed to the default location) or by deleting the `azd` binary manually. This will automatically install the correct version.

### Update `azd`

```bash
brew upgrade azd
```

### Uninstall `azd`

```bash
brew uninstall azd
```

### [Script](#tab/script-mac)

> [!NOTE]
> The `azd` install process will automatically choose the correct binary for the architecture of the machine.

The install script can be used to install the correct version of `azd` at the machine scope. 

```bash
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
```

### Update `azd`

```bash
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
```

### Uninstall `azd`

```bash
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/uninstall-azd.sh | bash
```

## Prerequisites

Before you get started using `azd`, ensure you have:

- Installed:
  - [Docker Desktop](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/docker-install) (other options coming soon.)
  - [Remote - Containers VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Install `azd` in a dev container

A [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) is a Docker image that includes all of the prerequisites you need to run an app on your local machine. Install `azd` as a feature in your dev container via the following steps:

1. Add the `azd` feature to the `devcontainer.json` file in the `.devcontainer` folder at the root of your template.

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Azure Developer CLI",
        "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.10-bullseye",
        "features": {
            // See https://containers.dev/features for list of features
            "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {
            },
            "ghcr.io/azure/azure-dev/azd:latest": {}
        }
        // Rest of file omitted...
    } 
    ```

1. Rebuild and run your dev container. In Visual Studio Code, use the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) to execute the **Rebuild and Reopen in Dev Container** command.

## Verify your installation

Verify your `azd` installation completed successfully by running the `azd version` command in a terminal:

```azdeveloper
azd version
```

`azd` prints the current version:

```output
azd version 1.9.5 (commit cd2b7af9995d358aab33c782614f801ac1997dde)
```

## Update the Azure Developer CLI

When working with an out of date version of `azd`, you'll see a warning to upgrade to the latest version. Follow the instructions in the warning to update to the latest version.
