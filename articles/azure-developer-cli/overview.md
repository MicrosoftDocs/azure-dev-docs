# What is the Azure Developer CLI?

Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) is an open-source tool that accelerates the time it takes for you to get your application from local development environment to Azure. `azd` provides best practice, developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your workflow, whether youâ€™re working in the terminal, your editor or integrated development environment (IDE), or CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment).

You can use `azd` with [extensible blueprint templates](./azd-templates.md) that include everything you need to get an application up and running on Azure. These templates include reusable infrastructure as code assets and proof-of-concept application code that can be replaced with your own app code. You can also [create your own template](./make-azd-compatible.md?pivots=azd-create) or find one to [build upon](./make-azd-compatible.md?pivots=azd-convert). 

## Typical `azd` workflow

Once you've [installed Azure Developer CLI](./install-azd.md), you can get your app running on Azure in just a few steps.

1. Select an [Azure Developer CLI template](./azd-templates.md#choose-a-template).
2. Initialize the project with the template by [running `azd init`](./get-started.md)
3. Package, provision and deploy the app by [running `azd up`](./get-started.md).
4. Continue iterating on your application code and deploying changes as needed by running `azd deploy`
5. Update Azure resources by modifying the template's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and then running `azd provision` (optional)
