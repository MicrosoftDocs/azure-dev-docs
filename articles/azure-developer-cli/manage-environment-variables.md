# Manage environment variables

Environment variables influence how resources are provisioned and deployed to Azure. This is especially useful when running azd in CI/CD workflow scenarios.

> [!TIP]
> For a comprehensive guide on creating and managing environments in Azure Developer CLI, see [Work with environments in Azure Developer CLI](./extensions/work-with-environments.md).

## Input Parameters Substitution

Environment variables can be referenced in parameter files (`*.parameters.json` for Bicep, `*.tfvars.json` for Terraform) as part of provisioning. When an environment variable substitution syntax is encountered, `azd` automatically substitutes the reference with the actual environment variable value set. Substitution also occurs for certain configuration settings in `azure.yaml` (properties documented with 'Supports environment variable substitution'), and in deployment configuration files, such as deployment manifests for `aks`.

### Input parameter substitution example (Bicep)

Suppose that you have the environment variable `AZURE_LOCATION` set:

```bash
export AZURE_LOCATION=westus3
```

```powershell
$env:AZURE_LOCATION='westus3'
```

In the `main.parameters.json` file, you can reference `AZURE_LOCATION` and allow for environment substitution using the following syntax:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "location": {
      "value": "${AZURE_LOCATION}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment-specific `.env` file

Outputs for infrastructure provisioning are automatically stored as environment variables in an `.env` file, located under `.azure/<environment name>/.env`. This setup allows for a local application, or deployment scripts, to use variables stored in the `.env` file to reference Azure-hosted resources if needed. To see these outputs, run `azd env get-values`, or `azd env get-values --output json` for JSON output.

### Environment variables provided by `azd`

The following are variables that are automatically provided by `azd`:

| Name  | Description  | Examples  | When available  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|`AZURE_ENV_NAME`     | The name of the environment in-use.       | `todo-app-dev`        | When an environment is created (after running azd init or azd env new, for example).        |
|`AZURE_LOCATION`     | The location of the environment in-use.        |  `eastus2`        |  Right before an environment is provisioned for the first time.       |
|`AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID`     | The running user/service principal.       | `925cff12-ffff-4e9f-9580-8c06239dcaa4`        | Determined automatically during provisioning (ephemeral).        |
|`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`    | The targeted subscription.       |  `925cff12-ffff-4e9f-9580-8c06239dcaa4`       | Right before an environment is provisioned for the first time.
|`SERVICE_<service>_IMAGE_NAME`     | The full name of the container image published to Azure Container Registry for container app services.        | `todoapp/web-dev:azdev-deploy-1664988805`        | After a successful publishing of a `containerapp` image        |

## User-provided environment variables

User-provided variables can be declared as an infrastructure output parameter (which is automatically stored in `.env`) in the `main.bicep` file, or set directly by the user in the environment (`azd env set <key> <value>`). `azd` reads the values as configuration and perform differently.

| Name  | Description  | Examples  | Effects  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|`AZURE_AKS_CLUSTER_NAME`     | The name of the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to target.     |   `aks-my-cluster`      |  Required property for deployment of an `aks` service.       |
|`AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`    | The specific resource group to target. Type string.   |  `rg-todo-dev`       | `azd` won't perform resource group discovery, and instead references this resource group. `azd` also doesn't control the authored IaC configuration files, thus changes to IaC files may be needed. |
|`AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`     | The Azure Container Registry endpoint to publish docker image. Type string.        |  `myexampleacr.azurecr.io`      |  Required property for deployment of a `containerapp` or `aks` service.        |
|`SERVICE_<service>_ENDPOINTS`    | The endpoints for the particular service. Type `array` (bicep) / `list-equivalent` (terraform).      | `['endpoint1', 'endpoint2']`      | Sets the public endpoints for the particular service will be used by azd for display. By default, azd discovers the automatically assigned hostnames for a given host, such as `*.azurewebsites.net` for `appservice`.        |

## Enable demo mode

`azd` includes a demo mode that hides your subscription ID in the console output. This feature is useful for scenarios where you want to demo or present `azd` commands in a public setting.

The demo mode introduces the environment variable: `AZD_DEMO_MODE`. To enable demo mode, run:

```bash
export AZD_DEMO_MODE true
```

If you want demo mode to persist across reboots, you can also run:

```bash
setx AZD_DEMO_MODE true
```

or in PowerShell:
```bash
$env:AZD_DEMO_MODE="true"
```
