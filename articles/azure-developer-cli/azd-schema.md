# Azure Developer CLI's azure.yaml schema

[`azd` templates](./azd-templates.md) are blueprint repositories that include proof-of-concept application code, editor/IDE configurations, and infrastructure code written in Bicep or Terraform. These templates are intended to be modified and adapted for your specific application requirements and then used to get your application on Azure using the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`). The [azure.yaml](https://aka.ms/azure.yaml.json) schema defines and describes the apps and types of Azure resources that are included in these templates.

## Sample

The following is a generic example of an `azure.yaml` required for your `azd` template.

```yaml
name: yourApp
metadata:
  template: yourApp@0.0.1-beta
services:
  web:
    project: ./src/web # path to your web project
    dist: build # relative path to service deployment artifacts
    language: js # one of the supported languages
    host: appservice # one of the supported Azure services
```

Compare with the [`azure.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-nodejs-mongo/blob/main/azure.yaml) from our [ToDo NodeJs Mongo template](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-nodejs-mongo):

```yaml
name: todo-nodejs-mongo
metadata:
  template: todo-nodejs-mongo@0.0.1-beta
services:
  web:
    project: ./src/web
    dist: build
    language: js
    host: appservice
  api:
    project: ./src/api
    language: js
    host: appservice
```

  api:
    project: ./src/api
      language: js
      host: appservice
infra:
  provider: terraform
```

### `services` properties

| Element Name | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `resourceName` | N | _(string)_ Name of the Azure resource that implements the service. If not specified, `azd` looks for a resource by `azd-env-name` and `azd-service-name` tags. If not found, it looks for a resource name constructed from the current environment name, concatenated with the service name (`<environment-name><resource-name>`). | `prodapi` |
| `project` | Y | _(string)_ Path to the service source code directory. |  |
| `host` | Y | _(string)_ Type of Azure resource used for service implementation. If omitted, App Service is assumed. | `appservice`, `containerapp`, `function`, `staticwebapp`, `aks` (only for projects deployable via `kubectl apply -f`), `springapp` (when [enabled](https://aka.ms/azd-may-2023) - learn more about [alpha features](./feature-versioning.md#alpha-features)) | 
| `language` | Y | _(string)_ Service implementation language. | `dotnet`, `csharp`, `fsharp`, `py`, `python`, `js`, `ts`, `java` |
| `module` | Y | _(string)_ Path of the infrastructure module used to deploy the service relative to the root infra folder. If omitted, the CLI assumes the module name is the same as the service name. |  |
| `dist` | Y | _(string)_ Relative path to the service deployment artifacts. The CLI uses files under this path to create the deployment artifact (.zip file). If omitted, all files under the service project directory are included. | `build` |
| `docker` | N | Only applicable when `host` is `containerapp`. Can't contain extra properties. | See the [custom Docker sample](#docker-options-sample). `path` _(string)_: Path to the Dockerfile. Default: `./Dockerfile`; `context` _(string)_: The docker build context. When specified, overrides default context. Default: `.`; `platform` _(string)_: The platform target. Default: `amd64`; `remoteBuild` _(boolean)_: Enables remote ACR builds. Default: `false` |
| `k8s` | N | The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) configuration options. | See the [AKS sample](#aks-sample-with-service-level-hooks). `deploymentPath` _(string)_: Optional. The relative path from the service path to the K8s deployment manifests. When set, it overrides the default deployment path location for K8s deployment manifests. Default: `manifests`; `namespace` _(string)_: Optional. The K8s namespace of the deployed resources. When specified, a new K8s namespace is created if it doesn't already exist. Default: `Project name`; `deployment` _(object)_: See [deployment properties](#aks-deployment-properties); `service` _(object)_: See [service properties](#aks-service-properties); `ingress` _(object)_: See [ingress properties](#aks-ingress-properties).  |
| `hooks` | N | Service level hooks. Hooks should match `service` event names prefixed with `pre` or `post` depending on when the script should execute. When you specify paths, they should be relative to the service path. | See [Customize your Azure Developer CLI workflows using command and event hooks](./azd-extensibility.md) for more details. |
| `apiVersion` | N | Specify an explicit `api-version` when deploying services hosted by Azure Container Apps (ACA). This feature helps you avoid using an incompatible API version and makes deployment more loosely coupled to avoid losing custom configuration data during JSON marshaling to a hard-coded Azure SDK library version. | `apiVersion: 2024-02-02-preview` |

#### Docker options sample

In the following example, we declare Docker options for a container app.

```yaml

#### Sample workflow

The following `azure.yaml` file changes the default behavior of `azd up` to move the `azd package` step after the `azd provision` step using a workflow. This example could be used in scenarios where you need to know the URLs of resources during the build or packaging process.

```yml
name: todo-nodejs-mongo
metadata:
  template: todo-nodejs-mongo@0.0.1-beta
workflows:
  up: 
    steps:
      - azd: provision
      - azd: deploy --all
```
