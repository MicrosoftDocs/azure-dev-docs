# Get started with the Azure Developer CLI compose feature

The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) composability (compose) feature enables you to progressively compose the Azure resources required for your app without manually writing Bicep code. Compose also uses [Azure Verified Modules (AVM)](https://aka.ms/avm) when possible, providing recommended practices using building blocks for Azure.

## What is the compose feature?

The `azd` compose feature offers a new way to get started with `azd`. Before the compose feature, developers had two primary options to configure the Azure resources to provision and deploy an application:

- Start with a [prebuilt template](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-templates), which defines resources and services to be provisioned and deployed on Azure, and then customize. Browse templates in the [AI template gallery](https://azure.github.io/ai-app-templates) or the [community gallery](https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/).
- Start from an existing codebase by following the instructions in the [simplified init flow](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/start-with-app-code).

Any further customization required the user to manually modify the Bicep filesâ€”until the introduction of the compose feature.

## Project compatability with compose

The `azd` compose feature is designed for projects that don't already use infrastructure as code to manage Azure resources. As a result, compose does *not* support the following scenarios:

- Projects that already have an `infra` folder for Azure resource creation (such as existing templates).
- .NET Aspire projects, which use the Aspire app host file to manage resources.

### Streamline resource creation with compose

The `azd` compose feature introduces a third option to add Azure resources to your apps. Developers use the `azd add` command to instruct `azd` to compose new Azure resources and update template configurations using minimal prompt workflows. This feature is useful for developers who want to avoid writing Bicep or using an existing template.

Run the `azd add` command to start the compose workflow and add a new resource:

```bash
azd add
```

This command begins a prompt-based workflow that allows you to select a new resource to create for your app:

```output
? What would you like to add?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> AI
  Database
  Host service
  Key Vault
  Messaging
  Storage account
  ~Existing resource
```

When you're finished adding resources with `azd add`, run `azd up` or `azd provision` to create the resources in Azure. `azd` manages resource creation internally until you [Generate Bicep files for the resources](compose-generate.md) for further customization.

Visit the [Build a minimal template using the compose feature](compose-quickstart.md) article for a full walkthrough of this feature.
