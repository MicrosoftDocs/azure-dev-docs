# Tutorial for Azure Functions: Clean up resources

[Previous step: Deploy the Functions app](tutorial-vscode-serverless-node-04.md)

The Functions App you created includes resources that can incur minimal costs (refer to [Functions Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/)). To clean up the resources, right-click the Function App in the **Azure: Functions** explorer and select **Delete Function App**.

You can also visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-side navigation pane, select the resource group that was created in the process of this tutorial, and then use the **Delete resource group** command.
