# Get started with the chat using your own data sample for JavaScript

This article shows you how to deploy and run the [Chat with your data sample for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript). This sample implements a chat app using JavaScript, Azure OpenAI Service, and [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) in Azure AI Search to get answers about rental properties. The rental properties chat app is seeded with data from markdown files (*.md) including a privacy policy, terms of service, and support. 

* [Demo JavaScript](https://aka.ms/azai/js/video) -  full stack video
* [Demo JavaScript](https://aka.ms/azai/js.py/video) - frontend with Python backend video

By following the instructions in this article, you will:

- Deploy a chat app to Azure.
- Get answers about rental properties website information.
- Change settings to change behavior of responses.

Once you complete this article, you can start modifying the new project with your custom code and data.

This article is part of a collection of articles that show you how to build a chat app using Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search. Other articles in the collection include: 

* [.NET](/dotnet/ai/get-started-app-chat-template)
* [Java](../java/quickstarts/get-started-app-chat-template.md)
* [Python](../python/get-started-app-chat-template.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses one or more [AI app templates](../ai/intelligent-app-templates.md) as the basis for the examples and guidance in the article. AI app templates provide you with well-maintained, easy to deploy reference implementations that help to ensure a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

## Architectural overview

A simple architecture of the chat app is shown in the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/simple-architecture-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing architecture from client to backend app.":::

The chat sample application is built for a fictitious company called _Contoso Real Estate_, and the intelligent chat experience allows its customers to ask support questions about the usage of its products. The sample data includes a set of documents that describe its terms of service, privacy policy and a support guide. The documents are ingested into the architecture during deployment.

The application is made from multiple components, including:

- **Search service**: the backend service that provides the search and retrieval capabilities.
- **Indexer service**: the service that indexes the data and creates the search indexes.
- **Web app**: the frontend web application that provides the user interface and orchestrates the interaction between the user and the backend services.

## Cost 

Most resources in this architecture use a basic or consumption pricing tier. Consumption pricing is based on usage, which means you only pay for what you use. To complete this article, there will be a charge but it will be minimal. When you're done with the article, you can delete the resources to stop incurring charges.

## Deploy and run

The sample repository contains all the code and configuration files you need to deploy a chat app to Azure. The following steps walk you through the process of deploying the sample to Azure.

### Deploy chat app to Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure resources created in this section incur immediate costs, primarily from the Azure AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. 

1. Run the following Azure Developer CLI command to provision the Azure resources and deploy the source code:

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```

1. If you're prompted to enter an environment name, keep it short and lowercase. For example, `myenv`. It's used as part of the resource group name. 
1. When prompted, select a subscription to create the resources in. 
1. When you're prompted to select a location the first time, select a location near you. This location is used for most the resources including hosting.
1. If you're prompted for a location for the OpenAI model, select a location that is near you. If the same location is available as your first location, select that.
1. Wait until app is deployed. It may take 5-10 minutes for the deployment to complete.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed, you see a URL displayed in the terminal. 
1. Select that URL labeled `Deploying service web` to open the chat application in a browser.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/browser-chat-with-your-data.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/browser-chat-with-your-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat app in browser showing several suggestions for chat input and the chat text box to enter a question.":::

### Use chat app to get answers from markdown files

The chat app is preloaded with rental information from a [markdown file catalog](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript/tree/main/data). You can use the chat app to ask questions about the rental process. The following steps walk you through the process of using the chat app.

1. In the browser, select or enter **What is the refund policy** in the text box at the bottom of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/browser-chat-initial-answer.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/browser-chat-initial-answer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat app's first answer.":::

1. From the answer, select **Show thought process**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/browser-chat-initial-answer-citation-highlighted.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/browser-chat-initial-answer-citation-highlighted.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat app's first answer with Show thought process highlighted in a red box.":::

1. In the right-pane, use the tabs to understand how the answer was generated.

    |Tab|Description|
    |---|---|
    |**Thought process**|This is a script of the interactions in chat. You can view the system prompt (`content`) and your user question (`content`).|
    |**Supporting content**|This includes the information to answer your question and the source material. The number of source material citations is noted in the **Developer settings**. The default value is **3**.|
    |**Citation**|This displays the original page that contains the citation.|

1. When you're done, select the _hide_ button denoted with an **X** above the tabs.

### Use chat app settings to change behavior of responses

The intelligence of the chat app is determined by the OpenAI model and the settings that are used to interact with the model. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/browser-chat-developer-settings-chat-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat developer settings":::

|Setting|Description|
|---|---|
|Override prompt template|This is the prompt that is used to generate the answer.|
|Retrieve this many search results|This is the number of search results that are used to generate the answer. You can see these sources returned in the _Thought process_ and _Supporting content_ tabs of the citation. |
|Exclude category|This is the category of documents that are excluded from the search results.|
|Use semantic ranker for retrieval|This is a feature of [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/semantic-search-overview#what-is-semantic-search) that uses machine learning to improve the relevance of search results.|
|Use query-contextual summaries instead of whole documents|When both `Use semantic ranker` and `Use query-contextual summaries` are checked, the LLM uses captions extracted from key passages, instead of all the passages, in the highest ranked documents.|
|Suggest follow-up questions|Have the chat app suggest follow-up questions based on the answer.|
|Retrieval mode|**Vectors + Text** means that the search results are based on the text of the documents and the embeddings of the documents. **Vectors** means that the search results are based on the embeddings of the documents. **Text** means that the search results are based on the text of the documents.|
|Stream chat completion responses|Stream response instead of waiting until the complete answer is available for a response.|

The following steps walk you through the process of changing the settings.

1. In the browser, select the **Developer Settings** tab.
1. Check the **Use query-contextual summaries instead of** checkbox and ask the same question again.

    ```
    What happens if the rental doesn't fit the description?
    ```

    The chat returned with a more concise answer such as the following.

## Clean up resources

### Clean up Azure resources

The Azure resources created in this article are billed to your Azure subscription. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete them to avoid incurring more charges.

Run the following Azure Developer CLI command to delete the Azure resources and remove the source code:

```bash
azd down --purge
```

### Clean up GitHub Codespaces

#### [GitHub Codespaces](#tab/github-codespaces)

Deleting the GitHub Codespaces environment ensures that you can maximize the amount of free per-core hours entitlement you get for your account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information about your GitHub account's entitlements, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Sign into the GitHub Codespaces dashboard (<https://github.com/codespaces>).

1. Locate your currently running Codespaces sourced from the [`Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript) GitHub repository.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/github-codespace-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of all the running Codespaces including their status and templates.":::

1. Open the context menu for the codespace and then select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/github-codespace-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the context menu for a single codespace with the delete option highlighted.":::

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

You aren't necessarily required to clean up your local environment, but you can stop the running development container and return to running Visual Studio Code in the context of a local workspace.

1. Open the **Command Palette**, search for the **Dev Containers** commands, and then select **Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/reopen-local-command-palette.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Command Palette option to reopen the current folder within your local environment.":::

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio Code will stop the running development container, but the container still exists in Docker in a stopped state. You always have the option to deleting the container instance, container image, and volumes from Docker to free up more space on your local machine.
