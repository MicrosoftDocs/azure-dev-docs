# Part 8 Clean up resources

[Previous step: Stream logs](tutorial-vscode-docker-node-07.md)

The App Service you created for the container includes a backing App Service Plan that can incur costs. To clean up the resources, right-click the App Service in the **Azure: App Service** explorer and select **Delete**.

You can also visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-side navigation pane, select the resource group that was created in the process of this tutorial, and then use the **Delete resource group** command.
