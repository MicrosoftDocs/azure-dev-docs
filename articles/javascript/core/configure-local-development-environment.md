# Configure your JavaScript develop environment for Azure

When creating cloud applications, developers typically prefer to test code on their local workstations before deploying that code to a cloud environment like Azure. Local development gives you the advantage of a wider variety of tools along with a familiar environment.

This article provides setup instructions to create and validate a local development environment that's suitable for JavaScript with Azure.

## One-time subscription creation

[Azure resources](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/organize-resources?tabs=AzureManagementGroupsAndHierarchy) are created within a subscription and resource group.

## One-time software installation

Azure development with JavaScript on your local workstation, we suggest you install the following:

|Name/Installer|Description|
|--|--|
|[Node.js LTS](https://www.npmjs.com/)|Install latest long-term support (LTS) runtime environment for local workstation development.|
|[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)| Visual Studio Code gives you a great JavaScript integration and coding experience but it isn't required. You can use any code editor.|
|[Visual Studio Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=azure&target=VSCode&category=Azure&sortBy=Relevance)|Install any relevant extensions for Azure services you intend to use.|

### Azure hosting runtime 

When you use an Azure resource as the hosting environment for your application, such as an Azure web app or Azure Functions, [verify your local Node.js development environment runtime version of Node.js](what-is-azure-for-javascript-development.md#verify-runtime-for-javascript-apps-hosted-in-azure) matches the Azure resource runtime you plan to use.

### Recommended local installations

The following common local workstation installations are recommended to help with your local development tasks.

|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|[Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli)|Local or cloud-based CLI to create and use Azure resources.|
|[Azure Developer CLI](../../azure-developer-cli/overview.md?tabs=nodejs)|Developer-centric command-line tool for building cloud apps in developer workflow.|
|[Visual Studio Code extensions for Azure](../node-azure-tools.md#visual-studio-code-extensions) |VS Code extensions to the IDE.|
|[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)| Command-line tools for source control. You can use a different source control tool if you prefer. |
|Docker for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)|Use [Development containers](https://containers.dev/) for consistent development environments.|
|Node.js LTS|[Learn more](#install-nodejs)|

## Install Node.js

The Azure SDK supports the [Node.js Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Read the [Azure SDK Support Policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md#microsoft-support-policy) for more details.

### Azure services Node.js minimum version

[!INCLUDE [Azure services Node.js minimum version](../includes/nodejs-runtime-for-azure-services.md)]

### Manage multiple versions of Node.js

When you need to manage more than one version of Node.js across your local and remote environments, we recommend:

* **NVM (Node Version Manager)**: A command-line interface to set or switch your local version of Node.js.
  * macOS, Linux - [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
  * Windows - [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)
* **Containers**: Use a container with a specific Node.js version. You can manage the version of Node.js across several environments using containers. Visual Studio Code's [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) simplifies this process.

### Download and install Node.js based on your intended use

You can download and install Node.js based on your requirements.

* [Node.js Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/)

## One-time configuration for authentication

To use the same authentication code in local development and the remote Azure hosting environment, use the [DefaultAzureCredential](/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#defaultazurecredential). Learn more about this [managed identity](../../intro/passwordless-overview.md).

## Create a resource group for your project

[!INCLUDE [create resource group 3-tab](../../includes/create-resource-group.md)]


## Working with Azure and the Azure SDK client libraries

The [Azure client libraries](../azure-sdk-library-package-index.md) are provided individually for each service. You install each library based on the Azure service you need to use.

Each new project using Azure should:

- Create Azure resources.
- Install Azure client libraries from a package manager such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/package). 
- Use [managed identity](../../intro/passwordless-overview.md) to authenticate with the Azure client library, then use configuration information to access specific services.

## Securing configuration information

You have several options to store configuration information:

- Azure [Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/) to create and maintain secrets, keys, and certificates that access cloud resources, which don't yet offer [managed identity access](../../intro/passwordless-overview.md).
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a popular npm package to read environment variables from a `.env` file. Make sure to add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` file so the `.env` file isn't checked into to source control. 

### Create environment variables

To use the Azure settings needed by the Azure SDK libraries to access the Azure cloud, set the most common values to environment variables. The following commands set the environment variables for the local workstation. 

In the following examples, the client ID is the service principal ID and service principal secret.

# [bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-TENANT-ID>"
AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-CLIENT-ID>"
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-CLIENT-SECRET>"
```

# [cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>"
set AZURE_TENANT_ID="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-TENANT-ID>"
set AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-CLIENT-ID>"
set AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AZURE-CLIENT-SECRET>"
```

---

Replace the values shown in these commands with those of your specific environment variable.

### Create `.env` file 

Another common mechanism is to use the `DOTENV` NPM package to create a `.env` file for these settings. If you plan to use a `.env`, make sure to add the file to the `.gitignore` so you **don't check in** the file to source control. Add the `.env` file to git's `.ignore` file is the standard way to ensure those settings are checked into source control.

## Install npm packages

For every project, we recommend that you always create a separate folder, and its own `package.json` file using the following steps:

1. Open a terminal, command prompt, or bash shell and create a new folder to the project. Then move into that new folder.

    ```console
    mkdir MY-NEW-PROJECT && cd MY-NEW-PROJECT
    ```

1. Initialize the package file:

    ```console
    npm init -y
    ```

    This creates the package.json file and initializes the minimum properties.

1. Install the Azure cl libraries you need, such as this example:

    ```console
    npm install @azure/identity
    ```

## Use source control with Visual Studio Code

We recommend that you get into the habit of creating a source control repository whenever you start a project. You can do this from Visual Studio Code. 

1. In Visual Studio Code, select the source control icon to open the **Source Control** explorer, then select **Initialize Repository** to initialize a local Git repository:

    ![Initialize git repository](../media/setup-environment/initialize-local-repository.png)

1. After the repository is initialized, and you have files to store in source control, enter the message `Initial commit` and select the checkmark to create the initial commit of your source files.

    ![Complete an initial commit to the repository](../media/setup-environment/initial-commit.png)

1. Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and copy the repository URL for the next few step. 

1. In the Visual Studio integrated terminal, use the following [git](https://git-scm.com/docs) command to add your remote repository to your local repository. Replace `YOUR-ALIAS` and `YOUR-REPOSITORY` with your own values.

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ALIAS/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    ```

Visual Studio Code includes many built-in git features. For more information, see [Using Version Control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol).
