# Create an Azure service principal for Node.js

When an app needs to access resources, you can set up an identity for the app and authenticate the app with its own credentials. This identity is known as a *service principal*. Essentially, you create keys for your Azure Active Directory account that you provide to the SDK to authenticate rather than requiring user intervention or username/password.

The service principal approach enables you to:
- Assign permissions to the app identity that are different than your own permissions. Typically, these permissions are restricted to exactly what the app needs to do.
- Use a certificate for authentication when running an unattended script.

This topic shows you three techniques for creating a service principal.

- Azure portal
- Azure CLI 2.0

## Create a service principal using the Azure CLI 2.0

To perform the following steps, [install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [sign in to Azure](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli). 

1. Get your subscription and tenant ID using the `az account list` command. You will need these when working with any of the Azure packages. The following shows an example of the output of this command:

	```shell
	{
	"cloudName": "AzureCloud",
	"id": "<subscriptionId>",
	"isDefault": true,
	"name": "<subscriptionName>",
	"registeredProviders": [],
	"state": "Enabled",
	"tenantId": "<tenantId>",
		"user": {
			"name": "hello@example.com",
			"type": "user"
		}
	}
    ```

1. Follow the steps outlined in the topic,
[Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli), to generate the service principal. The JSON object in the output will contain the information you would need to authenticate with Azure.

## Using the service principal

Once you have a service principal, you can:

1. Authenticate to Azure programmatically with the service principal with a certificate, environment variables, or a `.json` file. 
1. Create Azure resources with service principal and use the service.

Follow the [Authenticate with the Azure management modules for JavaScript](./node-sdk-azure-authenticate.md) topic for how to a create credentials object which you can use to authenticate your client with Azure Active Directory.
