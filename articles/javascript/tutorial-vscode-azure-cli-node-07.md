# Part 7: Clean up resources

[Previous step: Make changes and redeploy](tutorial-vscode-docker-node-06.md)

The App Service you created includes a backing App Service Plan that can incur costs. To clean up the resources, run the following command at a terminal or command prompt:

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

You can also visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-side navigation pane, select the resource group that was created in the process of this tutorial, and then use the **Delete resource group** command.
