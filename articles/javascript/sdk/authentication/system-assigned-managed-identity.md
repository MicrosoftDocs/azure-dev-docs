# Authenticate Azure-hosted JavaScript apps to Azure resources using a system-assigned managed identity

The recommended approach to authenticate an Azure-hosted app to other Azure resources is to use a [managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). This approach is [supported for most Azure services](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identities-status), including apps hosted on Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps, and Azure Virtual Machines. Discover more about different authentication techniques and approaches on the [authentication overview](overview.md) page. In the sections ahead, you'll learn:

- Essential managed identity concepts
- How to create a system-assigned managed identity for your app
- How to assign roles to the system-assigned managed identity
- How to authenticate using the system-assigned managed identity from your app code

[!INCLUDE [Implement user-assigned managed identity](<../../../includes/authentication/managed-identity-concepts.md>)]

The following sections describe the steps to enable and use a system-assigned managed identity for an Azure-hosted app. If you need to use a user-assigned managed identity, visit the [user-assigned managed identities](user-assigned-managed-identity.md) article for more information.

### Implement the code

Add the [Azure.Identity](/dotnet/api/azure.identity) package. In an ASP.NET Core project, also install the [Microsoft.Extensions.Azure](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.azure) package:

### [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

In a terminal of your choice, navigate to the application project directory and run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Azure
```

### [NuGet Package Manager](#tab/nuget-package)

Right-click your project in the Visual Studio **Solution Explorer** window and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Search for **Azure.Identity**, and install the matching package. Repeat this process for the **Microsoft.Extensions.Azure** package.

Azure services are accessed using specialized client classes from the various Azure SDK client libraries. These classes and your own custom services should be registered for dependency injection so they can be used throughout your app. In `Program.cs`, complete the following steps to configure a client class for dependency injection and token-based authentication:

1. Include the `Azure.Identity` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Azure` namespaces via `using` directives.
1. Register the Azure service client using the corresponding `Add`-prefixed extension method.
1. Pass an appropriate `TokenCredential` instance to the `UseCredential` method:
    - Use `DefaultAzureCredential` when your app is running locally.
    - Use `ManagedIdentityCredential` when your app is running in Azure.

An alternative to the `UseCredential` method is to provide the credential to the service client directly:

The preceding code behaves differently depending on the environment where it's running:

- On your local development workstation, `DefaultAzureCredential` looks in the environment variables for an application service principal or at locally installed developer tools, such as Visual Studio, for a set of developer credentials.
- When deployed to Azure, `ManagedIdentityCredential` discovers your managed identity configurations to authenticate to other services automatically.
