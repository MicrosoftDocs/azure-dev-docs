# Authenticate Azure-hosted JavaScript apps to Azure resources using a system-assigned managed identity

The recommended approach to authenticate an Azure-hosted app to other Azure resources is to use a [managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). This approach is [supported for most Azure services](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identities-status), including apps hosted on Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps, and Azure Virtual Machines. Discover more about different authentication techniques and approaches on the [authentication overview](overview.md) page. In the sections ahead, you'll learn:

- Essential managed identity concepts
- How to create a system-assigned managed identity for your app
- How to assign roles to the system-assigned managed identity
- How to authenticate using the system-assigned managed identity from your app code

The following sections describe the steps to enable and use a system-assigned managed identity for an Azure-hosted app. If you need to use a user-assigned managed identity, visit the [user-assigned managed identities](user-assigned-managed-identity.md) article for more information.
