# How to authenticate JavaScript apps to Azure services using the Azure Identity library

[!INCLUDE [Create app registration step 1](<../../../includes/authentication/overview-para-1.md>)] This article describes the recommended approaches to authenticate an app to Azure when using the Azure SDK for JavaScript.

## Recommended app authentication approach

### Advantages of token-based authentication

Use the following library: 

* [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity)

### DefaultAzureCredential

## Use DefaultAzureCredential in an application

[DefaultAzureCredential](credential-chains.md#use-defaultazurecredential-for-flexibility) is an opinionated, ordered sequence of mechanisms for authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID. Each authentication mechanism is a class derived from the [TokenCredential](/javascript/api/@azure/core-auth/tokencredential?view=azure-node-latest&preserve-view=true) class and is known as a *credential*. At runtime, `DefaultAzureCredential` attempts to authenticate using the first credential. If that credential fails to acquire an access token, the next credential in the sequence is attempted, and so on, until an access token is successfully obtained. In this way, your app can use different credentials in different environments without writing environment-specific code.

To use [DefaultAzureCredential](/javascript/api/@azure/identity/defaultazurecredential), add the [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) package to your application.

```terminal
npm install @azure/identity
```

Then, the following [code sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureStorageSnippets/blob/master/blobs/howto/JavaScript/NodeJS-v12/dev-guide/connect-with-default-azure-credential.js) shows how to instantiate a `DefaultAzureCredential` object and use it with an Azure SDK service client class&mdash;in this case, a `BlobServiceClient` used to access Azure Blob Storage.

```javascript
import { BlobServiceClient } from '@azure/storage-blob';
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from '@azure/identity';
import 'dotenv/config';

const accountName = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME;
if (!accountName) throw Error('Azure Storage accountName not found');

const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
  `https://${accountName}.blob.core.windows.net`,
  new DefaultAzureCredential()
);
```
