# How to log with Azure SDK client libraries

To diagnose an unexpected issue or to understand what any Azure SDK client library for JavaScript is doing, [enable logging](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core#logging) in your app. You can do this with either of the methods below:

* Use `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL=verbose` environment variable to turn on logging.
* Use `@azure/logger` package in your source code.

Valid log levels include `verbose`, `info`, `warning`, and `error`.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js LTS.</a>
- Optional, authentication tool such as [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) used for authentication in a local development environment, create the necessary context by signing in with the Azure CLI. 

## Debug with environment variable

A simple way to use the environment variable is to start the application with the environment variable.

```shell
AZURE_LOG_LEVEL=verbose node index.js
```

## Debug with logger package in source code

The following code sample uses the [@azure/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/logger) package to debug the Azure SDK client libraries. 

1. Create `index.js` with the following code:

    ```javascript
    import { 
        ChainedTokenCredential, 
        ManagedIdentityCredential, 
        AzureCliCredential 
    } from "@azure/identity";
    import { BlobServiceClient } from "@azure/storage-blob";
    import { AzureLogger, setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

    // Turn on debugging    
    setLogLevel("verbose");
    AzureLogger.log = (...args) => {
        console.log(...args);
    };

    const credential = new ChainedTokenCredential(
        new ManagedIdentityCredential({ clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" }),
        new AzureCliCredential()
    );
    
    const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
        "https://dinaberrystor.blob.core.windows.net",
        credential
    );
    // get container properties
    const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient("<CONTAINER_NAME>");
    
    async function main(){
        const properties = await containerClient.getProperties();
        console.log(properties);
    }
    
    main().catch((err) => {
        console.error("Error running sample:", err.message);
    });
    ```

2. Install the npm dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install @azure/identity @azure/storage-blob
    ```

3. Sign into your Azure subscription in your local environment with Azure CLI:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

4. Run the app:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

5. Find the successful credential: `getToken() => SUCCESS`.

    ```output
    ...
    azure:identity:info AzureCliCredential => getToken() => SUCCESS. Scopes: https://storage.azure.com/.default.
    azure:identity:info ChainedTokenCredential => getToken() => Result for AzureCliCredential: SUCCESS. Scopes: https://storage.azure.com/.defau
    lt.
    ```
