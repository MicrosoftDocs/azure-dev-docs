# 2. Create Application Insights resource for web pages

In this step of the tutorial, create an Azure resource group for all your Azure resources and a Monitor resource to collect your web app's log files to the Azure cloud. Azure Monitor is the name of the Azure service, while Application Insights is the name of the client library the tutorial uses. 

## Create a resource group for your virtual machine resources

This tutorial includes several Azure resources. Creating a resource group allows you to easily find the resources, and delete them when you are done.

1. At a terminal or bash shell, enter the [Azure CLI command to create an Azure resource group](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az_group_create), with the name `rg-demo-vm-eastus`:

    ```azurecli
    az group create \
        --location eastus \
        --name rg-demo-vm-eastus 
    ```

## Create Azure Monitor resource with Azure CLI

1. Install Application Insights extension to the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az extension add -n application-insights
    ```

1. Use the following command to [create a monitoring resource](/cli/azure/ext/application-insights/monitor/app-insights/component?view=azure-cli-latest#ext_application_insights_az_monitor_app_insights_component_create):


    ```azurecli
    az monitor app-insights component create \
      --app demoWebAppMonitor \
      --location eastus \
      --resource-group rg-demo-vm-eastus
    ```

    In the results, find and copy the `instrumentationKey`. You will need that later. 

1. Leave the terminal open, you will use it in the next step.
