# 5. Install Azure SDK client library to monitor web app

In this step, add the Azure SDK client library to the code on the virtual machine to begin collecting app logs in the Azure cloud.

## Edit index.js for logging with Azure Monitor Application Insights

1. Use the [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html#Editor-Basics) text editor provided in the virtual machine to edit the `index.js`. 

    ```bash
    sudo nano index.js
    ```

1. Edit the `index.js` file to add the client library and logging code, highlighted below. Many bash shells allow you to copy and paste directly into nano. 

    :::code language="JavaScript" source="~/../js-e2e-vm/index-logging.js" highlight="5-28" :::

1. When you are done, use `Control+x` to quit, then `y` to save the changes. Changes to the web app are watched by PM2; this change caused a restart of the app, without having to restart the VM. 

1. In a web browser, test the app with the new `trace` route:

    ```http
    http://REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-IP/trace
    ```

    The browser displays the response, `tracing...` with your IP address.

## Viewing the VM logs for NGINX and PM2

The VM collects logs for NGINX and PM2, they are available to view.

| Service | Log location|
|--|--|
|NGINX| /var/log/nginx/access.log|
|PM2| /var/log/pm2.log|

1. View VM log for the NGINX proxy service. In the same bash shell, use the following command to view the log:

    ```bash
     cat /var/log/nginx/access.log
    ```

    The log includes the call from your local computer. 

    ```console
     "GET /trace HTTP/1.1" 200 10 "-"
    ```

1. View VM log for the PM2 service. In the same bash shell, use the following command to view the log:

    ```bash
     cat /var/log/pm2.log
    ```

    The log includes the call from your local computer. 

    ```console
    Hello world app listening on port 3000!
    testing from trace route 76.22.73.183
    ```

1. The tutorial won't connect to the VM again. Exit the ssh connection with the following command in the bash shell. 

    ```bash
    exit
    ```
