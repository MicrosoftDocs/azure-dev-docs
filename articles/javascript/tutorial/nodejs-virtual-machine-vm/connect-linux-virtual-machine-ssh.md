# 4. Connect to Linux virtual machine using SSH

In this section of the tutorial, use SSH in a terminal to connect to your virtual machine. [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/) is a common tool provided with many modern shells, including the Azure Cloud Shell. 

## Connect with SSH and change web app

Use the same terminal or shell window as with previous steps. 

1. Connect to your remote virtual machine with the following command. This process assumes that your SSH client can find your SSH keys, created as part of your VM creation and placed on your local machine. If you are asked if you want to continue connecting, answer `yes`. When the connection is complete, the terminal prompt should change to indicate the remote virtual machine. 

    Replace `YOUR-PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS` with your own virtual machine's public Ip. 

    ```console
    ssh azureuser@YOUR-PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS
    ``` 

1. Use the following command to understand where you are on the virtual machine. You should be at the azureuser root: `/home/azureuser`. 

    ```bash
    pwd
    ```

1. Your web app is in the subdirectory, `myapp`. Change to the `myapp` directory and list the contents:

    ```bash
    cd myapp && ls -l
    ```

    You should see contents like, representing the GitHub repository cloned into the virtual machine and the npm package files:
    
    ```console
    -rw-r--r--   1 root root   891 Nov 11 20:23 cloud-init-github.txt
    -rw-r--r--   1 root root  1347 Nov 11 20:23 index-logging.js
    -rw-r--r--   1 root root   282 Nov 11 20:23 index.js
    drwxr-xr-x 190 root root  4096 Nov 11 20:23 node_modules
    -rw-r--r--   1 root root 84115 Nov 11 20:23 package-lock.json
    -rw-r--r--   1 root root   329 Nov 11 20:23 package.json
    -rw-r--r--   1 root root   697 Nov 11 20:23 readme.md
    ```

1. Install the [Azure SDK client library for Application Insights](https://www.npmjs.com/package/applicationinsights).

    ```bash
    sudo npm install --save applicationinsights
    ```

1. Use [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html#Editor-Basics) editor to change the `package.json` file.

    ```bash
    sudo nano package.json
    ```

1. Edit the file's start script to include an environment variable. Replace `REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-KEY` with your instrumentation key value.

    ```json
    "start": "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY=REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-KEY pm2 start index.js --watch --log /var/log/pm2.log"
    ```

1. Stop and restart PM2 with the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo npm run-script stop && sudo npm start
    ```

    The Azure client library is now in your _node_modules_ directory and the key is passed into the app as an environment variable. The next step is to add the required code to `index.js`. 

1. Leave the terminal open and connected to your VM, you will use it in the next step.
