# 7. Clean up resources

Once you have completed this tutorial, you need to remove the resource group, which includes all its resources to make sure you are not billed for any more usage. 

## Remove all the resources by removing resource group

In the same terminal, use the [Azure CLI command](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az_group_delete) to delete the resource group:

```azurecli
az group delete --name rg-demo-vm-eastus -y
```

This command takes a few minutes.
