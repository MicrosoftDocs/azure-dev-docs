# 6. View logs in Azure portal

In this section of the tutorial, learn how to see your logging with Azure Monitor and Application Insights. 

## Count of traces in logs with Azure CLI

Use Azure CLI to quickly see important pieces of your logs. For example, use the following command to see how many traces are in the logs. 

Remember the trace was added in the `/trace` route only. Calls to the root of your web app will not produce any trace logs. 

```azurecli
az monitor app-insights metrics show \
    --resource-group rg-demo-vm-eastus \
    --app demoWebAppMonitor \
    --metric traces/count
```

The response looks something like the following, with this example having a total count of 2 traces: 

```console
{
  "value": {
    "end": "2020-11-11T21:33:40.311000+00:00",
    "interval": null,
    "segments": null,
    "start": "2020-11-11T20:33:40.311000+00:00",
    "traces/count": {
      "sum": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## View application traces in Azure portal

To view your traces as a list, the easiest method is to use the Azure portal. 

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseAll) in a web browser.
1. Filter the list of resource by the resource group, `rg-demo-vm-eastus`. 
1. Select the `demoWebAppMonitor` resource. 
1. Select the **Monitoring** section's **Logs** item. If a pop-up displays queries you can select from, select **X** in the corner to dismiss the pop-up.
1. Select the **Application Insights** item named **traces** by double-clicking on it. That adds the name to the query window. 
1. Run the query by selecting the **Run** button.
1. The Azure Monitor application insights custom traces, from the web app, appear in a list.
