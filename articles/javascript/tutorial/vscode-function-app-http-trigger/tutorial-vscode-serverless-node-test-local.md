# 3. Test the function locally

[Previous step: Create the Functions app](tutorial-vscode-serverless-node-create-local.md)

In this step, you run the Azure Functions project locally to test it before deploying to Azure. Set a break point just before the serverless function returns the response. 

## Run the local serverless function
1. Run `func host start` to start the server

1. In Visual Studio Code, press **F5**  to launch the debugger and attach to the Azure Functions host. 

    You could also use the **Debug** > **Start Debugging** menu command.
    
1. Output from the Functions Core tools appears in the VS Code **Terminal** panel. Once the host has started, **Alt**+click the local URL shown in the output to open the browser and run the function:

    ![Output shown in VS Code Terminal panel when debugging locally](../../media/functions-extension/local-test-output.png)

    The code created by the default HTTP trigger template parses a `name` query parameter to customize the response. 

1. In your browser, enter the URL displayed in the terminal, then add `?name=YOUR-NAME` to the end of URL, replacing `YOUR-NAME` with your name:

## Set and stop at break point in serverless app

With your function running locally, set breakpoints on different parts of the code. 

1. Open *index.js*, then click in the margin to the left of line 9 in the editor window. 
1. A small red dot appears to indicate a breakpoint. 
1. Remove the `?name=` argument from the URL in the browser and re-submit the browser request to the function. 
1. When the browser makes that request, VS Code stops the function code on that breakpoint:

    ![VS Code stopped on a breakpoint](../../media/functions-extension/debugging-breakpoint.png)

    To learn more about breakpoints and debugging in VS Code, see [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

1. Stop the debugger in Visual Studio Code. 

## Same Local and Azure Function runtime 

When you created the Functions app, the Azure Functions extension automatically added a VS Code launch configuration to your project, which is found in the *.vscode/launch.json* file. This configuration uses the same runtime that runs on Azure, so you can be sure that your source code works before deploying to the cloud.
