# Create the app code using Express

[Previous step: Introduction and prerequisites](tutorial-vscode-azure-cli-node-01.md)

In this step, you create a simple Node.js app with [Express](https://www.expressjs.com) using the [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

1. Use the following command to run the Express Generator and scaffold a new Express app called "myExpressApp". (The `--view pug --git` parameters tell the generator to use the [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) template engine, formerly known as Jade, and to create a *.gitignore* file.)

    ```bash
    npx express-generator myExpressApp --view pug â€“git
    ```

1. Navigate into the app folder and install the app's dependencies by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd myExpressApp
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the app server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1. Open a browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the running app:

1. When you're done testing the app, stop the server by pressing **Ctrl**+**C** in the terminal where you ran `npm start`.
