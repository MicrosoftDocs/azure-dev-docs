# Part 6 Make changes and redeploy

[Previous step: Stream logs](tutorial-vscode-azure-cli-node-05.md)

In this step, you make changes to your app code, commit them to the local Git repository, and then redeploy your site by pushing to Azure.

1. In the `myExpressApp` folder, open the *views/index.pug* file and change the message in line 5 to `p Welcome to Azure!`.

1. Save the file.

1. In a terminal or command prompt, commit the changes to git by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "Edited message"
    ```

1. Push the changes to the Git remote named Azure that we created earlier:

    ```bash
    git push azure master
    ```

1. Because the App Service is already connected to the Git repository, the output from the command shows that changes are automatically published to Azure:
