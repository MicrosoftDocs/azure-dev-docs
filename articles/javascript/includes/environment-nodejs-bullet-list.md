* [Node.js 8+](https://www.npmjs.com/): Install latest long-term support (LTS) runtime environment for local workstation development. A package manager is also required. Node.js installs NPM in the 8.x version. The Azure SDK generally requires a minimum version of Node.js of 8.x. Azure hosting services, such as Azure App service, provides runtimes with more recent versions of Node.js. If you target a minimum of 8.x for local and remove development, your code should run successfully.
