In this section of the tutorial, you create the Azure Storage resource with a Visual Studio extension then configure the resource in the Azure portal. 

## Sign in to Azure

[!INCLUDE [azure-sign-in](azure-sign-in.md)]

## Create Storage resource 

Use the Visual Studio Code extension to create a Storage resource. 

1. Navigate to the Azure Storage extension. Right-click on the subscription then select `Create Storage Account...`.

1. Follow the prompts using the following table to understand how your values are used.

    |Property|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Enter a globally unique name for the new web app.| Enter a value such as `fileuploadyourname`, for your Storage resource name. Replace `yourname` with your lowercase name or unique ID. This unique name is also used as part of the URL to access the resource in a browser. Use only characters and numbers, up to 24 in length. You need this **account name** to use later.|

1. When the app creation process is complete, a notification appears with information about the new resource.

## Set storage account name in code file

Set the resource name in `src/uploadToBlob.ts` for the `storageAccountName` value by adding the storage key name into the empty string. Leave the rest of the code as it is. 

```typescript
const storageAccountName = process.env.storageresourcename || ""; 
```

## Generate your shared access signature (SAS) token 

Generate the SAS token before configuring CORS. 

1. In the Visual Studio Code extension for Storage, right-click the resource then select **Open in Portal**. This opens the Azure portal to your exact Storage resource.
1. In the **Settings** section, select **Shared access signature**. 
1. Configure the SAS token with the following settings. 

    | Property|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Allowed services|Blob|
    |Allowed resource types|Service, Container, Object|
    |Allowed permissions|Read, write, delete, list, add, create|
    |Enable deletions of version|Checked|
    |Start and expiry date/time|Accept the start date/time and set the end date time 24 hours in the future. Your SAS token is only good for 24 hours.|
    |HTTPS only|Selected|
    |Preferred routing tier|Basic|
    |Signing Key|key1 selected|

1.  Select **Generate SAS and connection string**. Immediately copy the SAS token. You won't be able to list this token so if you don't have it copied, you will need to generate a new SAS token. 

## Set SAS token in code file

The SAS token value is a partial query string and is used in the URL when queries are made to your cloud-based resource.

The token format depends are which tool you used to create it: 
* **Azure portal**: If you create your SAS token in the portal, the token includes the `?` as the first character of the string.
* **Azure CLI**: If you create your SAS token with the Azure CLI, the value returned doesn't include the `?` as the first character of the string. 

1. Remove the `?`, if it is the first character of the token. The code file provides the `?` for you so you don't need it in the token.

1. Set the SAS token into `src/uploadToBlob.ts` for the sasToken value by adding the SAS token into the empty string. Leave the rest of the code as it is. 

```typescript
// remove `?` if it is first character of token
const sasToken = process.env.storagesastoken || "";
```

## Configure your Azure Storage resource for CORS with Azure CLI

Configure CORS for your resource so the client-side React code can access your storage account. 

1. While still in the Azure portals, in the Settings section, select **CORS**. 
1. Configure CORS as show in the image. The settings are explained below the image. 

    | Property|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Allowed origins|`*`|
    |Allowed methods|All except patch.|
    |Allowed headers|`*`|
    |Exposed headers|`*`|
    |Max age|86400|

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/tutorial-browser-file-upload/azure-portal-storage-blob-cors.png" alt-text="Configure CORS as show in the image. The settings are explained below the image.":::

1. Select **Save** above the settings to save them to the resource. The code doesn't require any changes to work with these CORS settings. 

## Run project locally to verify connection to Storage account

Your SAS token and storage account name are set in the `src/uploadToBlob.ts` file, so you are ready to run the application.

1. From the Visual Studio Code terminal, enter the following command:

    ```javascript
    npm start
    ```

1. When the terminal displays the URL, such as `http://localhost:3000`, your app is ready. Open a browser and enter that URL. The website connected to Azure Storage blobs should display with a file selection button and a file upload button. 

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/tutorial-browser-file-upload/browser-react-app-azure-storage-resource-configured-upload-button-displayed.png" alt-text="The React website connected to Azure Storage blobs should display with a file selection button and a file upload button.":::

1. Select an image from the `images` folder to upload. The `spring-flowers.jpg` are a good visual for this test. The select the **Upload!** button. 

    The React front-end client code calls into the `src/uploadToBlob.ts` to authenticate to Azure, then create a Storage Container (if it doesn't already exist), then uploads the file to that container. 

## Troubleshooting

If you received an error or your file doesn't upload to the container, check the following:

* Recreate your SAS token, making sure that your token is created at the Storage resource level and not the container level. Copy the new token into the code at the correct location.
* Check that the token string you copied into the code doesn't contain the `?` (question mark) at the beginning of the string.
* Verify your CORS setting for your Storage resource.
