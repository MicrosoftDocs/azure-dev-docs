In this section, we'll remove and cleanup all the created resources.

## Remove your resources

The App Service you created includes a backing App Service Plan running on a free pricing tier, so you won't incur any ongoing costs.

When you want to clean up the resources, visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups**, locate, and select the resource group that was created in the process of this tutorial (such as `deno-quickstart`), and then use the **Delete resource group** command.
