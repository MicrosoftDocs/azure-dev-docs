# Get started with Serverless AI Chat with RAG using LangChain.js

Creating AI apps can be complex. With LangChain.js, Azure Functions, and Serverless technologies, you can simplify this process. These tools manage infrastructure and scale automatically, letting you focus on chatbot functionality. The chatbot uses enterprise documents to generate AI responses.

The code includes sample data for a fictitious company. Customers can ask support questions about the company's products. The data includes documents on the company's terms of service, privacy policy, and support guide.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses one or more [AI app templates](../../ai/intelligent-app-templates.md) as the basis for the examples and guidance in the article. AI app templates provide you with well-maintained, easy to deploy reference implementations that help to ensure a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

## Architectural overview

### The chat app

The user interacts with the application:

- The chat interface in the client web app for the conversation.
- The client web app sends the user's query to the Serverless API via HTTP calls.
- The Serverless API creates a chain to coordinate interactions between Azure AI and Azure AI Search to generate an answer.
- The PDF document retrieval by using Azure Blob Storage.
- The generated response is then sent back to the web app and displayed to the user.

A simple architecture of the chat app is shown in the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="../media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/simple-architecture-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing architecture from client to backend app.":::

### LangChain.js simplifies the complexity between services

The API flow is useful to understand how LangChain.js is helpful in this scenario by abstracting out the interactions. The **serverless API endpoint**:

- Receives the question from the user.
- Creates client objects:
  - Azure OpenAI for embeddings and chat
  - Azure AI Search for the vector store
- Creates a document chain with the LLM model, the chat message (system and user prompts), and the document source.
- Creates a retrieval chain from the document chain and the vector store.
- Streams the responses from the retrieval chain.

The developer's work is to correctly configure the dependencies services, such as Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search and construct the chains correctly. The underlying chain logic allows you to construct chains from many different services and configurations as long as they work with the LangChain.js requirements.

### Where is Azure in this architecture?

This application is made from multiple components:

- A web app made with a single chat web component built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) and hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](/azure/static-web-apps). The code is located in the `packages/webapp` folder.

- A serverless API built with [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions) and using [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) to ingest the documents and generate responses to the user chat queries. The code is located in the `packages/api` folder.

- An [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/) service to create embeddings and generate an answer.  

- A database to store the text extracted from the documents and the vectors generated by LangChain.js, using [Azure AI Search](/azure/search).

- A file storage to store the source documents, using [Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction).
