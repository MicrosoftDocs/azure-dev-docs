# Enterprise-grade reference for composable architecture

This reference architecture contains the components for building enterprise-grade modern composable frontends (or micro-frontends) and cloud-native applications. It's a collection of best practices, architecture patterns, and functional components that can be used to build and deploy modern JavaScript applications to Azure.

## What is Contoso?

Contoso Corporation is a fictional but representative global manufacturing conglomerate with its headquarters in Paris. The company deployed Microsoft 365 for enterprise with to accelerate its digital transformation by using cloud services to bring together its employees, partners, data, and processes to create customer value and maintain its competitive advantage in a digital-first world.

Contoso is expanding to new regions and countries, which results in massive hiring. They offer relocation and have designed an application, to help HR and new hires find the right housing. This web app is an internal tool used by Contoso HR and new hire or relocating employees.

Both authenticated Talent Managers, and new hires can interact with the application features, while nonauthenticated users can access some parts of it.

## Enterprise developer experience

The developer experience for the HR app is: 

1. **Define** priority scenarios: What are the core application scenarios?
2. **Design** reference architecture: with Cloud-native and Azure.
3. **Develop** reference implementation: Project structure, code patterns, and best practices.
4. **Deploy** Code-to-Cloud: Simplified developer experience for build-to-deploy.
5. **Document** content resources: Training modules, documentation, and GitHub sample.

## Composable cloud native HR app

The architect designs a cloud native solution for the developer.

## Simplified flow

The HR app is built as:

* UI for portal and blog front ends as vertical micro frontend splits - denoted as 1 and 2 in the diagram.
* API layer to communicate between client and cloud.
* Microservices for cloud integrations.

|#|Name|Description|
|:--|:--|--|
|1|**Blog** (UI)|Powered by Next.js front-end and Strapi back-end, both hosted from single Azure Container App. Azure Container App also hosted Stripe payment gateway integration.|
|2|**Main portal** (UI)|The Angular front-end deployed to the Azure cloud via Static Web Apps.|
|3|**APIs**|The API layer is build with Azure API Management to manage authorization, rate limiting, and caching.|
|4|**Storage** (Backend)|The storage layer for blobs and data is built with several Azure services. PostgreSQL is used for read-only and searchable data, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB is used for read/write data. Azure Blob Storage is used for storing images and other artifacts.|
|5|**Microservices** (Backend)| The microservices layer is built with Azure Functions and Node.js with Fastify, and the payment service is containerized and deployed to Azure Container Apps|
|6|**Payments**|The payments layer is built with Stripe.|
