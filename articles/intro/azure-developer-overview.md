Azure is a cloud platform designed to simplify the process of building modern applications. Whether you choose to host your applications entirely in Azure or extend your on-premises applications with Azure services, Azure helps you create applications that are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

Azure supports the most popular programming languages in use today, including Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET, and Go. With a comprehensive SDK library and extensive support in tools you already use like VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, and Eclipse. Azure builds on the skills you already have and helps you be productive right away.

## Application development scenarios on Azure

Incorporate Azure into your application in different ways depending on your needs. The following video provides a helpful overview of the most popular development scenarios for Azure developers:

Common software development and deployment scenarios on Azure:

- **Application hosting on Azure -** Host your entire application stack: web applications, APIs, databases, and storage services. Azure supports various hosting models from fully managed services to containers to virtual machines. When you use fully managed Azure services, your applications take advantage of the scalability, high availability, and security built into Azure.

- **Consuming cloud services from existing on-premises applications -** Extend existing on-premises apps with Azure services. For example, an application can use Azure Blob Storage to store files, Azure Key Vault to securely store application secrets, or [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) to add full-text search capability. These fully managed services integrate with your apps without changing your application architecture or deployment model.

- **Container based architectures -** Use container-based services to modernize your apps. Whether you need a private registry for container images, you're containerizing an existing app for easier deployment, deploying microservices-based applications, or managing containers at scale, Azure has solutions that support your needs.

- **AI driven applications -** Build AI-powered applications on your terms, in your preferred programming language, in the cloud, on-premises, or at the edge. Get tools, services, and guidelines to help you apply AI responsibly in your applications while preserving data privacy, transparency, and trust. Use Azure AI to add speech, vision, language, and decision capabilities to your applications, create chatbots, and uncover insights with AI-powered search.

- **Modern serverless architectures -** Use Azure Functions to simplify building event-driven solutions, whether responding to HTTP requests, handling file uploads in Blob storage, or processing queue events. You write only the code necessary to handle your event without worrying about servers or framework code. Use over 250 connectors to Azure and other services to tackle integration problems.


How do you implement those scenarios? The next article, "Key Azure services for developers", gives several Azure service options to implement each scenario.
