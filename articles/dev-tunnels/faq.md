## What is dev tunnels?

Dev tunnels allow developers to securely share local web services across the internet. There are many use cases including: sharing in-progress work without having to deploy an application; prototyping applications locally that need the ability to receive webhook notifications from other services; working with local web services during mobile development.

## Is dev tunnels available on all platforms?

Dev tunnels are available cross-platform on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## When are unused dev tunnels deleted?

After 30 days of no activity.

## Is it better to recreate dev tunnels or reuse the same dev tunnel?

We'd recommend reusing the same tunnel when it's convenient, rather than creating a new one for every use. It's also slightly faster to get an existing tunnel compared to creating a new one. In addition, by reusing the same tunnel, the tunnel web forwarding URL can be stable instead of changing on every use.

## Can anonymous users create dev tunnels?

No, anonymous users can't create dev tunnels. All creation of tunnels requires either a Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft, or GitHub account.
