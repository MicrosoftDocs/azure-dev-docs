By default, GitHub Copilot uses **ask** mode. Ask mode provides answers to your prompts in the chat pane. **Agent** mode enables GitHub Copilot to take action in your workspace.

## Agent mode

In Agent mode, GitHub Copilot can perform tasks across your entire Visual Studio workspace, making edits, executing terminal commands, and so on.

To switch, between ask and agent mode, select the down chevron next to the Ask option in the chat area and select the desired mode.
