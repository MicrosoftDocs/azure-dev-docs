# Manage storage accounts by using the Azure Explorer for IntelliJ

> [!NOTE]
> The Storage Accounts feature in Azure Explorer is deprecated. You can utilize the Azure portal to create and manage storage accounts and containers. See the [Azure Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) documentation for quickstarts on how to manage storage accounts.

The Azure Explorer, which is part of the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ, provides Java developers with an easy-to-use solution for managing storage accounts in their Azure account from inside the IntelliJ integrated development environment (IDE).

## Create a storage account

To create a storage account by using the Azure Explorer, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to your Azure account by using the steps in [Sign-in instructions for the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ].

1. In the **Azure Explorer** view, expand the **Azure** node, right-click **Storage Account**, and then click **Create**.

1. In the **Create Storage Account** dialog box, specify the following options:

   * **Project details**:

      * **Subscription**: Specifies the Azure subscription that you want to use for the new storage account.

      * **Resource Group**: Specifies the resource group for your storage account. Select one of the following options:

         * **Create new**: Specifies that you want to create a new resource group by clicking **+** to finish.

         * **Use existing**: Specifies that you'll select from a dropdown list of resource groups that are associated with your Azure account.

   * **Instance details**:

      * **Account name**: Specifies the name for the new storage account, which must be between 3 and 24 characters long, start with a letter, and contain only lowercase letters and numbers.

      * **Account location**:  Specifies the location where your storage account will be created (for example, *West US*).

      * **Performance**: Specifies which storage account offering to use from the selected publisher (for example, *Premium*). For more information, see [Azure storage scalability and performance targets].

      * **Redundancy**: Specifies the replication for the storage account (for example, *Zone-Redundant*). For more information, see [Azure storage replication].

      * **Kind**: Specifies the type of storage account to create (for example, *Block Blobs storage*). And this option will show only if you choose "Premium" in the **Performance**. For more information, see [About Azure storage accounts].

1. When you've specified all of the preceding options, click **OK**.

## Delete a storage account

To delete a storage account by using the Azure Explorer, use the following steps:

1. In the **Azure Explorer** view, right-click the storage account, and then select **Delete**.
