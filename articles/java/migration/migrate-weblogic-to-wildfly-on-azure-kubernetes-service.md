# Migrate WebLogic applications to WildFly on Azure Kubernetes Service

This guide describes what you should be aware of when you want to migrate an existing WebLogic application to run on WildFly in an Azure Kubernetes Service container.

## Pre-migration

To ensure a successful migration, before you start, complete the assessment and inventory steps described in the following sections.

If you can't meet any of the pre-migration requirements, see the companion migration guide:

* [Migrate WebLogic applications to Azure Virtual Machines](migrate-weblogic-to-virtual-machines.md)

[!INCLUDE [inventory-all-certificates](includes/inventory-all-certificates.md)]

[!INCLUDE [inventory-jndi-resources](includes/inventory-jndi-resources.md)]

### Determine whether session replication is used

If your application relies on session replication, with or without Oracle Coherence*Web, you have two options:

* Refactor your application to use a database for session management.
* Refactor your application to externalize the session to Azure Redis Service. For more information, see [Azure Cache for Redis](/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview).

### Determine whether WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST) is used

If you currently use WLST to perform the deployment, you'll need to assess what it's doing. If WLST is changing any (runtime) parameters of your application as part of the deployment, you'll need to make sure those parameters conform to one of the following options:

* They are externalized as app settings.
* They are embedded in your application.
* They are using the JBoss CLI during deployment.

If WLST is doing more than what is mentioned above, you'll have some additional work to do during migration.

### Determine whether your application uses WebLogic-specific APIs

If your application uses WebLogic-specific APIs, you'll need to refactor it to remove those dependencies. For example, if you have used a class mentioned in the [Java API Reference for Oracle WebLogic Server](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-server/12.2.1.4/wlapi/index.html?overview-summary.html), you have used a WebLogic-specific API in your application.

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-the-java-ee-application-client-feature-is-in-use-aks](includes/determine-whether-the-java-ee-application-client-feature-is-in-use-aks.md)]

### Determine whether a deployment plan was used

If your app was deployed using a deployment plan, you'll need to assess what the deployment plan is doing. If the deployment plan is a straight deploy, then you'll be able to deploy your web application without any changes. If the deployment plan is more elaborate, you'll need to determine whether you can use the JBoss CLI to properly configure your application as part of the deployment. If it isn't possible to use the JBoss CLI, you'll need to refactor your application in such a way that a deployment plan is no longer needed.

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-ejb-timers-are-in-use](includes/determine-whether-ejb-timers-are-in-use.md)]

### Determine whether and how the file system is used

Any usage of the file system on the application server will require reconfiguration or, in rare cases, architectural changes. The file system may be used by WebLogic shared modules or by your application code. You may identify some or all of the scenarios described in the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [static-content](includes/static-content.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dynamic-or-internal-content-aks](includes/dynamic-or-internal-content-aks.md)]

### Determine whether JCA connectors are used

If your application uses JCA connectors, you'll have to validate that the JCA connector can be used on WildFly. If the JCA implementation is tied to WebLogic, you'll have to refactor your application to remove that dependency. If it can be used, then you'll need to add the JARs to the server classpath and put the necessary configuration files in the correct location in the WildFly server directories for it to be available.

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-jaas-is-in-use](includes/determine-whether-jaas-is-in-use.md)]

### Determine whether WebLogic clustering is used

Most likely, you've deployed your application on multiple WebLogic servers to achieve high availability. Azure Kubernetes Service is capable of scaling, but if you've used the WebLogic Cluster API, you'll need to refactor your code to eliminate the use of that API.

## Migration

[!INCLUDE [create-a-docker-image-for-wildfly](includes/create-a-docker-image-for-wildfly.md)]

[!INCLUDE [build-and-push-the-docker-image-to-azure-container-registry](includes/build-and-push-the-docker-image-to-azure-container-registry.md)]

[!INCLUDE [provision-a-public-ip-address](includes/provision-a-public-ip-address.md)]

[!INCLUDE [deploy-to-aks](includes/deploy-to-aks.md)]

### Configure persistent storage

If your application requires non-volatile storage, configure one or more [Persistent Volumes](/azure/aks/azure-disks-dynamic-pv).

[!INCLUDE [migrate-scheduled-jobs-aks](includes/migrate-scheduled-jobs-aks.md)]

## Post-migration

Now that you've migrated your application to Azure Kubernetes Service, you should verify that it works as you expect. After you've done that, see the following recommendations to make your application more cloud-native.
