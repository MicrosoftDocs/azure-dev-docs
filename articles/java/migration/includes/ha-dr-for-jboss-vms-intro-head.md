This tutorial shows you a straightforward and effective way to implement high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR) for Java using JBoss EAP on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). The solution illustrates how to achieve a low Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) using a simple database-driven Jakarta EE application running on the JBoss EAP application server. HA/DR is a complex topic, with many possible solutions. The best solution depends on your unique requirements. For other ways to implement HA/DR, see the resources at the end of this article.
