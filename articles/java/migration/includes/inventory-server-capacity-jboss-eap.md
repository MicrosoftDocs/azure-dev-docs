### Inventory server capacity

Document the hardware (memory, CPU, disk) of the current production server(s) and the average and peak request counts and resource utilization. You'll need this information regardless of the migration path you choose. It's useful, for example, to help guide selection of the App Service Plan.

The [list of available App Service Plan tiers](https://azure.microsoft.com/details/app-service/linux/) shows the memory, CPU cores, storage, and pricing information. Note that JBoss EAP on App Service is only available on the **Premium V3** and **Isolated V2** App Service Plan tiers.
