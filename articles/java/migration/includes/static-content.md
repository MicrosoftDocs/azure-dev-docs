#### Read-only static content

If your application currently serves static content, you'll need an alternate location for it. You may wish to consider moving static content to Azure Blob Storage and adding Azure CDN for lightning-fast downloads globally. For more information, see [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website) and [Quickstart: Integrate an Azure storage account with Azure CDN](/azure/cdn/cdn-create-a-storage-account-with-cdn).

#### Dynamically published static content

If your application allows for static content that is uploaded/produced by your application but is immutable after its creation, you can use Azure Blob Storage and Azure CDN as described above, with an Azure Function to handle uploads and CDN refresh. We've provided a sample implementation for your use at [Uploading and CDN-preloading static content with Azure Functions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-java-push-static-contents-to-cdn).
