### Account for the use of Custom Security Providers and JAAS

If your application is using JAAS, you need to make sure the configuration of security providers is correctly migrated. For more information, see [About Configuring WebLogic Security Providers](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/wls/SECMG/providers_intro.htm) in the Oracle documentation.
