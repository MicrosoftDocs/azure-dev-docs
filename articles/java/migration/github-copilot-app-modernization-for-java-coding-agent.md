# Modernizing Java Apps Using GitHub Copilot App Modernization in Coding Agent

## Overview

This article provides an overview of how Java developers can modernize their applications using **GitHub Copilot App Modernization** within the [**Copilot Coding Agent**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent). The agent can work independently in the background to complete modernization tasks—just like a human developer. Developers can delegate tasks via issues or pull requests, and the agent executes them in the cloud, helping teams complete the entire modernization journey efficiently.  

## Prerequisites
