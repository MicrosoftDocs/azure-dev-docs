# Tutorial: Migrate WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty to Azure Kubernetes Service with high availability and disaster recovery

This tutorial shows you a simple and effective way to implement high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR) for Java using WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The solution illustrates how to achieve a low Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) using a simple database-driven Jakarta EE application running on WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty.

HA/DR is a complex topic, with many possible solutions. The best solution depends on your unique requirements. For other ways to implement HA/DR, see the resources at the end of this article.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Use Azure optimized best practices to achieve high availability and disaster recovery.
> - Set up a Microsoft Azure SQL Database failover group in paired regions.
> - Set up the primary WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster on AKS.
> - Set up disaster recovery for the cluster using Azure Backup.
> - Set up the secondary AKS cluster.
> - Set up an Azure Traffic Manager.
> - Test failover from primary to secondary.

The following diagram illustrates the architecture you build:

Azure Traffic Manager checks the health of your regions and routes the traffic accordingly to the application tier. Both the primary region and the secondary region have a full deployment of the Liberty cluster. However, only the primary region is actively servicing network requests from the users. The secondary region is passive, and is activated to receive traffic only when the primary region experiences a service disruption. Azure Traffic Manager uses the health check feature of the Azure Application Gateway to implement this conditional routing. The primary cluster is running and the secondary cluster is shut down. The geo-failover RTO of the application tier depends on the time for starting virtual machines (VMs) and running the secondary cluster. The RPO depends on the Azure SQL Database because the data is persisted and replicated in the Azure SQL Database failover group.

The database tier consists of an Azure SQL Database failover group with a primary server and a secondary server. The read/write listener endpoint always points to the primary server and is connected to a WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster in each region. A geo-failover switches all secondary databases in the group to the primary role. For the geo-failover RPO and RTO of Azure SQL Database, see [Overview of business continuity with Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/business-continuity-high-availability-disaster-recover-hadr-overview?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true).

This tutorial was written with the Azure Backup and Azure SQL Database services because the tutorial relies on the HA features of these services. Other database choices are possible, but you must consider the HA features of whatever database you choose.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
- Make sure you're assigned either the `Owner` role or the `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles in the subscription. You can verify the assignment by following the steps in [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal).
- Prepare a local machine with Windows, Linux, or macOS installed.
- Install and set up [Git](/devops/develop/git/install-and-set-up-git).
- Install a Java SE implementation, version 17 or later - for example, [the Microsoft build of OpenJDK](/java/openjdk).
- Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), version 3.9.3 or later.

## Set up an Azure SQL Database failover group in paired regions

In this section, you create an Azure SQL Database failover group in paired regions for use with your WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty clusters and app. In a later section, you configure WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty to store its session data to this database. This practice references [Creating a table for session persistence](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-nd/9.0.5?topic=persistence-creating-table-session).

First, create the primary Azure SQL Database by following the Azure portal steps in [Quickstart: Create a single database - Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-portal). Follow the steps up to, but not including, the "Clean up resources" section. Use the following directions as you go through the article, then return to this article after you create and configure the Azure SQL Database.

When you reach the section [Create a single database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-portal#create-a-single-database), use the following steps:

1. In step 4 for creating new resource group, save aside the **Resource group name** value - for example, `myResourceGroup`.
1. In step 5 for database name, save aside the **Database name** value - for example, `mySampleDatabase`.
1. In step 6 for creating the server, use the following steps:
   1. Fill in a unique server name - for example, `sqlserverprimary-mjg032524`.
   1. For **Location**, select **(US) East US**.
   1. For **Authentication method**, select **Use SQL authentication**.
   1. Save aside the **Server admin login** value - for example, `azureuser`.
   1. Save aside the **Password** value.
1. In step 8, for **Workload environment**, select **Development**. Look at the description and consider other options for your workload.
1. In step 11, for **Backup storage redundancy**, select **Locally-redundant backup storage**. Consider other options for your backups. For more information, see the [Backup storage redundancy](/azure/azure-sql/database/automated-backups-overview?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true#backup-storage-redundancy) section of [Automated backups in Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/automated-backups-overview?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true).
1. In step 14, in the **Firewall rules** configuration, for **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server**, select **Yes**.

Then, create an Azure SQL Database failover group by following the Azure portal steps in [Configure a failover group for Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/failover-group-configure-sql-db?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-portal&pivots=azure-sql-single-db). You just need the following sections: [Create failover group](/azure/azure-sql/database/failover-group-configure-sql-db?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-portal&pivots=azure-sql-single-db#create-failover-group) and [Test planned failover](/azure/azure-sql/database/failover-group-configure-sql-db?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-portal&pivots=azure-sql-single-db#test-planned-failover). Use the following steps as you go through the article, then return to this article after you create and configure the Azure SQL Database failover group:

1. When you reach the section [Create failover group](/azure/azure-sql/database/failover-group-configure-sql-db?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-portal&pivots=azure-sql-single-db#create-failover-group), use the following steps:
   1. In step 5 for creating the failover group, enter and save aside the unique failover group name - for example, `failovergroup-mjg032524`.
   1. In step 5 for configuring the server, select the option to create a new secondary server and then use the following steps:
      1. Enter a unique server name - for example, `sqlserversecondary-mjg032524`.
      1. Enter the same server admin and password as your primary server.
      1. For **Location**, select **(US) West US**.
      1. Make sure **Allow Azure services to access server** is selected.
   1. In step 5 for configuring the **Databases within the group**, select the database you created in the primary server - for example, `mySampleDatabase`.

1. After you complete all the steps in the section [Test planned failover](/azure/azure-sql/database/failover-group-configure-sql-db?view=azuresql-db&preserve-view=true&tabs=azure-portal&pivots=azure-sql-single-db#test-planned-failover), keep the failover group page open and use it for the failover test of the WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty clusters later.

## Set up the primary WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster on AKS

In this section, you create the primary WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster on AKS using the [IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service](https://aka.ms/liberty-aks) offer. The secondary cluster is restored from the primary cluster during the failover using Azure Backup later.

### Deploy the primary WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster

Use the following steps to deploy the primary cluster:

1. Open the [IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service](https://aka.ms/liberty-aks) offer in your browser and select **Create**. You should see the **Basics** pane of the offer.

1. Use the following steps to fill out the **Basics** pane:

   1. Ensure that the value shown for **Subscription** is the same one that has the roles listed in the prerequisites section.
   1. You must deploy the offer in an empty resource group. In the **Resource group** field, select **Create new** and fill in a unique value for the resource group - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524`.
   1. Under **Instance details**, for **Region**, select **East US**.
   1. Select **Next** to go to the **AKS** pane.

1. Wait for a while. You should see all fields prepopulated with the defaults in the **AKS** pane. Select **Next** to go to the **Load balancing** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-aks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service AKS pane." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-aks.png":::

1. Use the following steps to fill out the **Load balancing** pane:

   1. For **Connect to Azure Application Gateway?**, select **Yes**.
   1. Leave the defaults for other fields.
   1. Select **Next** to go to the **Operator and application** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-load-balancing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service Load balancing pane." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-load-balancing.png":::

1. Use the following steps to fill out the **Operator and application** pane:

   1. Leave the defaults for all fields.

      > [!NOTE]
      > This tutorial deploys Open Liberty Operator using the defaults. Optionally you can deploy WebSphere Liberty Operator by selecting **Yes** for **IBM supported?**.

   1. Select **Review + create**.
   1. Wait until **Running final validation...** successfully completes, then select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-operator-and-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service Operator and application pane." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-operator-and-application.png":::

After a while, you should see the **Deployment** page where **Deployment is in progress** is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see any problems during **Running final validation...**, fix them and try again.

Depending on network conditions and other activity in your selected region, the deployment can take up to about 30 minutes to complete. After that, you should see the text **Your deployment is complete** displayed on the deployment page.

### Verify the deployment of the cluster

You deployed an AKS cluster, an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance, and an Azure Application Gateway in the primary region. The AKS cluster is the target computing platform where your app is deployed and running. The ACR instance stores the application image that AKS pulls during the app deployment. The Azure Application Gateway acts as load balancer for the application deployed to the AKS cluster.

Use the following steps to verify these key components before you move to the next step:

1. Return to the **Deployment** page, then select **Outputs**.
1. Copy the value of the property **cmdToConnectToCluster**. Open a terminal, paste the copied command, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute. You should see a message similar to the following example included in the output:

   ```output
   Merged "cluster3984d1-admin" as current context in <your-user>\.kube\config
   ```

1. Save aside the command so you can use it to connect to the cluster later.

1. Run `kubectl get pod --all-namespaces` in the terminal to list all pods running on the AKS cluster. You should see output similar to the following example:

   ```output
   NAMESPACE      NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE

   ```

1. Run `kubectl get secret` in the terminal to list all secrets installed on the AKS cluster. You should see one secret in the output, as shown in the following example:

   ```output
   NAME           TYPE                DATA   AGE
   secret3984d1   kubernetes.io/tls   2      24m
   ```

   This secret is a TLS secret that includes certificate and key data for TLS traffic. Copy and save aside the name of the secret - for example, `secret3984d1`, you use it in the app deployment later.

1. Switch back to **Outputs** page. Copy the value of the property **cmdToLoginInRegistry**. Paste the copied command in the terminal and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute. You should see **Login Succeeded** in the output. Keep the terminal open and use it for further configuration of the WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster later.

Use the following steps to get the name and DNS name of the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway. You use them for app deployment and the Azure Traffic Manager setup later.

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, enter *Resource groups* and select **Resource groups** from the search results.
1. Select the name of resource group for your primary region - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524`.
1. Find the **Public IP address** resource prefixed with `gwip`, then copy and save aside its name.
1. Select the **Public IP address** resource, then copy and save aside the **DNS name** - for example, `olgw3984d1.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`.

### Enable geo-replications for the ACR instance

The ACR instance is designed to store application images for both primary and secondary clusters. Use the following steps to enable geo-replications for the ACR instance:

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, enter *Resource groups* and select **Resource groups** from the search results.
1. Select the name of resource group for your primary region - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524`.
1. Find the **Container registry** resource prefixed with `acr`, then select it to open it.
1. Select **Properties**. For **Pricing plan**, select **Premium**, then select **Save**. Wait until completion.
1. Select **Geo-replications**, then select **Add**. For **Location**, select **West US**, then select **Create**. Wait until completion.
1. Wait for a while, select **Refresh**. Repeat the operation until you see two locations are listed and **Status** is **Ready**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/acr-geo-replications-enabled-in-paired-regions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the ACR instance enabled with geo-replications in pair regions." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/acr-geo-replications-enabled-in-paired-regions.png" border="false":::

Use the following steps to get the ACR sign-in credentials. You use them for app deployment later.

1. Select **Access keys**.
1. Copy and save aside the value for **Login server**, **Username**, and **password**.

### Deploy a sample app

Use the following steps to deploy and run a sample CRUD Java/Jakarta EE application on WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster for disaster recovery failover test later:

1. Download the sample by using the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks.git
   cd open-liberty-on-aks
   export BASE_DIR=$PWD
   git checkout 20240325
   ```

   The application configures a data source [jdbc/JavaEECafeDB](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks/blob/20240325/java-app/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml#L31-L39) that connects to the Azure SQL Database you deployed previously. The data source is used for [storing HTTP session data](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks/blob/20240325/java-app/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml#L28-L29), which enables failover and load balancing across a cluster of WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty servers. The sample app also configures a [persistence schema](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks/blob/20240325/java-app/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml#L6-L18) to persist application data `coffee` in the same datasource. Notice that the context root of the sample is configured as */* in the [server.xml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks/blob/20240325/java-app/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml#L24-L26) file.

1. Use the following commands to define environment variables with the values that you saved aside previously:

   ```bash
   export DB_SERVER_NAME=<failover-group-name>.database.windows.net
   export DB_NAME=mySampleDatabase
   export DB_USER=azureuser@<failover-group-name>
   export DB_PASSWORD='<SQL-Server-admin-login-password>'
   export LOGIN_SERVER=<ACR-login-server>
   export USER_NAME=<ACR-username>
   export PASSWORD='<ACR-password>'
   export INGRESS_TLS_SECRET=<TLS-secret-name>
   ```

1. Use the following commands to package the app, build the Docker image, push the image to the ACR instance, and deploy the sample to the AKS cluster:

   ```bash
   cd $BASE_DIR/java-app
   mvn clean install

   cd $BASE_DIR/java-app/target

   # If you deployed WebSphere Liberty Operator previously, use "Dockerfile-wlp" instead of "Dockerfile"
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t javaee-cafe:v1 --pull --file=Dockerfile .
   docker tag javaee-cafe:v1 ${LOGIN_SERVER}/javaee-cafe:v1
   docker login -u ${USER_NAME} -p ${PASSWORD} ${LOGIN_SERVER}
   docker push ${LOGIN_SERVER}/javaee-cafe:v1

   cd $BASE_DIR/java-app/target
   kubectl apply -f db-secret.yaml

   # If you deployed WebSphere Liberty Operator previously, use "webspherelibertyapplication-agic.yaml" instead of "openlibertyapplication-agic.yaml"
   kubectl apply -f openlibertyapplication-agic.yaml
   ```

1. Run the following command to get the sample app you deployed:

   ```bash
   # If you deployed WebSphere Liberty Operator previously, use "WebSphereLibertyApplication" instead of "OpenLibertyApplication"
   kubectl get OpenLibertyApplication
   ```

   You should see one **READY** application in the output:

   ```output
   NAME                       IMAGE                                 EXPOSED   RECONCILED   RESOURCESREADY   READY   AGE
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic   acr3984d1.azurecr.io/javaee-cafe:v1             True         True             True    45s
   ```

1. Run the following command to get status of the pods created during the deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   The following example indicates that all the pods are running. If you don't see similar output, wait for a while and repeat the operation.

   ```output
   NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic-6bbb8d6f5c-2xjc4   1/1     Running   0          1m
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic-6bbb8d6f5c-4f449   1/1     Running   0          1m
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic-6bbb8d6f5c-m2wg6   1/1     Running   0          1m
   ```

1. Use the following steps to verify that the app is running as expected:

   1. In a new browser tab, open the DNS name of the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway that you saved aside previously. Use the `https` protocol - for example, `https://olgw3984d1.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`. You should see the welcome page of sample app.
   1. Create a new coffee with name and price - for example, *Coffee 1* with price *10* - which is persisted into both the application data table and the session table of the database. The UI that you see should be similar to the following screenshot:

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/sample-app-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sample application UI." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/sample-app-ui.png":::

   If your UI doesn't look similar, troubleshoot and resolve the problem before you continue.

## Set up disaster recovery for the cluster using Azure Backup

In this section, you set up disaster recovery for the AKS cluster in the primary region using Azure Backup.

### Create a storage account

AKS backup uses a blob container to hold the AKS cluster resources. You create another blob container as a staging location for use during cross region restoring.

Use the following steps to create a storage account and two containers. Some of these steps direct you to other guides.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/publicportal).
1. Create a storage account by following the steps in [Create a storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create). You don't need to do all the steps in the article. Fill out the fields as shown on the **Basics** pane, using the following steps:
   1. For **Resource group**, select the existing resource group where the primary cluster is deployed - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524`.
   1. For **Storage account name**, enter a unique name - for example, `storageeastusmjg032524`.
   1. For **Region**, select **East US**.
   1. Select **Review + create** to accept the default options.
   1. Proceed to validate and create the account, then return to this article.
1. Create a storage container for the AKS Backup Extension by following the steps in [Create a storage container](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container). This guide uses `aks-backup-ext` as the container name.
1. Create another storage container as a staging location for use during restoring. This guide uses `staging` as the container name.

### Enable the AKS Backup Extension

Before you continue, use the following steps to install the AKS Backup Extension to the cluster in primary region:

1. Enable the CSI drivers and snapshots for your cluster. For the following `az aks update` command, update the value of Bash variable `RG_NAME` to your resource group name - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524` - and run in your local Bash terminal.

   ```azurecli
   export RG_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-resource-group>
   export AKS_NAME=$(az aks list \
       --resource-group ${RG_NAME} \
       --query "[0].name" \
       --output tsv | tr -d '\r')

   az aks update \
       --resource-group ${RG_NAME} \
       --name ${AKS_NAME} \
       --enable-disk-driver \
       --enable-file-driver \
       --enable-blob-driver \
       --enable-snapshot-controller --yes
   ```

   It takes about 5 minutes to enable the drivers. Make sure the commands complete without error before you continue.

1. Open the resource group that has AKS deployed - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524`. Select the AKS cluster from resources list.
1. Under **Settings** of the AKS landing page, select **Back up**, then select **Install Extension**.
1. In the **Install AKS Backup extension** page, select **Next**. Select the storage account `storageeastusmjg032524` and the blob container `aks-backup-ext` created in the same resource group. Select **Next**, then select **Create**. It takes about five minutes to complete this step.

### Back up the AKS cluster

Use the following steps to back up the AKS cluster:

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, search for *Backup vaults*. You see it listed under **Services**. Select it.
1. Follow the steps in [Back up Azure Kubernetes Service by using Azure Backup](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup) to enable AKS Backup for the primary cluster. Execute the steps up to, but not including, the [Use hooks during AKS backup](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup#use-hooks-during-aks-backup) section, and use the rest of the steps in this section to make adjustments as you go.

1. When you reach the [Create a Backup vault](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup#create-a-backup-vault) section, use the following steps:
   1. For step 1, for **Resource group**, select the existing resource group where the primary cluster is deployed - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524`. 
   1. For **Backup vault name**, enter a unique value  - for example, `aks-backup-vault-eastus-mjg032524`.
   1. For **Region**, select **East US**.
   1. For **Backup Storage Redundancy**, select **Globally-Redundant**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backupvault-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Backup Vault Basic pane." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backupvault-basics.png":::

   1. For step 2, for **Cross Region Restore**, select **Enable**.

1. When you reach the [Create a backup policy](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup#create-a-backup-policy) section, use the following steps:
   1. For step 3, enter a name for the backup policy - for example, `aksbackuppolicy`.
   1. Select the Backup vault you created in the same resource group - for example, `aks-backup-vault-eastus-mjg032524`.
   1. For step 4, add a retention rule where Vault-standard is selected.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/vault-standard-retention-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Create Backup Policy page with the Add retention pane open and the Vault-standard option highlighted." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/vault-standard-retention-rule.png":::

   1. Select **Add**.

1. In the [Configure backups](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup#configure-backups) section, use the following steps:
   1. Skip step 1-5, which are for AKS Extension installation. Start from step 6 for the AKS cluster in the primary region.
   1. For step 7, for **Vault**, select the backup vault you created in the same resource group - for example, `aks-backup-vault-eastus-mjg032524`. When you run into permission errors, select **Grant Permissions** to move on. After the permission deployment completes, if the error still shows, select **Revalidate** to refresh the role assignments.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-configure-backup-grant-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Configure Backup Basics pane with permission errors and with the Grant Permissions link highlighted." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-configure-backup-grant-permission.png":::

   1. For step 10, find **Select Resources to Backup**. For **Backup Instance name**, fill in a unique name - for example, `akseastusmjg032524`. For **Other options**, select all the options. Make sure **Include Secrets** is selected.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-configure-backup-select-resources.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Select Resources to Backup pane with the Include Secrets option highlighted." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-configure-backup-select-resources.png":::

   1. For step 11, you run into Role assignment error. Follow step 12-14 to mitigate the error.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-configure-backup-validation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Configure Backup pane with the Grant missing permissions dialog box open." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-configure-backup-validation.png":::

   1. After you select **Configure backup** in step 15, you return to the **Backup** page. Wait for a while and then select **Refresh**. Repeat the operation until you see that the backup instance is listed and its **Protection status** is **Protection configured**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-backup-instance-protection-configured.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the AKS backup instance protection is configured." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/aks-backup-instance-protection-configured.png":::

### Wait for a Vault-standard backup to happen

In AKS, the Vault-standard Tier is the only tier that supports *Geo-redundancy* and *Cross Region Restore*. As stated in [Which backup storage tier does AKS backup support?](/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-backup-overview#which-backup-storage-tier-does-aks-backup-support), "Only one scheduled recovery point per day is moved to Vault Tier." You must wait for a Vault-standard backup to happen. A good lower bound is to wait at most 24 hours after completing the previous step before you restore.

Use the following steps to verify that a Vault-standard backup is available:

1. In **Backup** page of the primary AKS cluster, select the backup instance.
1. Wait for a while and select **Refresh**. Repeat the operation until you see that at least one **Operational and Vault-standard** restore point is listed in the **RESTORE POINTS** section.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-operational-and-vault-standard-restorepoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Restore points section with the Operational and Vault-standard restore point highlighted." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-operational-and-vault-standard-restorepoint.png":::

## Set up the secondary AKS cluster

While waiting for a Vault-standard backup for the primary AKS cluster to happen, set up your secondary AKS cluster for restoring later.

Use the same steps in the section [Deploy the primary WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty cluster](#deploy-the-primary-websphere-libertyopen-liberty-cluster) to set up the secondary AKS cluster in the secondary region, except for the following differences:

1. In the **Basics** pane, use the following steps:
   1. In the **Resource group** field, select **Create new** and fill in a different unique value for the resource group - for example, `liberty-aks-westus-mjg032524`.
   1. Under **Instance details**, for **Region**, select **West US**.

1. In the **AKS** pane, use the following steps:
   1. Under **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, for **Select ACR instance**, select **No**.
   1. Select the existing ACR instance in the primary region that enabled with geo-replications.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-aks-select-existing-acr-in-primary-region.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal Create IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service page with the ACR instance highlighted." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/portal-aks-select-existing-acr-in-primary-region.png":::

Use the same steps in the section [Verify the deployment of the cluster](#verify-the-deployment-of-the-cluster) to verify the deployment in the secondary region, except for the following differences:

1. You don't need to copy and save aside the name of the TLS secret. The TLS secret is restored from the backup of the primary AKS cluster.
1. Use the resource group of the secondary cluster - for example, `liberty-aks-westus-mjg032524` - when you look up the the name and DNS name of the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway deployed in the secondary region.

Use the same steps in the section [Create a storage account](#create-a-storage-account) to create a storage account in secondary region, except for the following differences:

1. For **Resource group** field, select the existing resource group where the secondary cluster is deployed - for example, `liberty-aks-westus-mjg032524`.
1. For **Storage account name**, enter a unique name - for example, `storagewestusmjg032524`.
1. For **Region**, select **West US**.

Use the same steps in the section [Enable the AKS Backup Extension](#enable-the-aks-backup-extension) to install the AKS Backup Extension for the cluster in the secondary region, except for the following differences:

1. In step 1 for enabling the CSI drivers and snapshots for your secondary cluster, update the value of Bash variable `RG_NAME` to the resource group in the secondary region - for example, `liberty-aks-westus-mjg032524`.
1. In step 2, select the AKS cluster from the resource group in the secondary region - for example, `liberty-aks-westus-mjg032524`.
1. In step 4 for installing the AKS Backup Extension for your secondary cluster, select the storage account you created in the same resource group of the secondary region - for example, `storagewestusmjg032524`.

To save costs, stop the AKS cluster in the secondary region by following the steps in [Stop and start an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](/azure/aks/start-stop-cluster). You need to start it before you restore the cluster later.

## Set up an Azure Traffic Manager

Vault-standard backup was mentioned in section [Wait for a Vault-standard backup to happen](#wait-for-a-vault-standard-backup-to-happen). After you see that a Vault-standard backup is available, you can create an Azure Traffic Manager for distributing traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions. The primary endpoint points to the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway in the primary region. The secondary endpoint points to the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway in the secondary region.

Create an Azure Traffic Manager profile by following the steps in [Quickstart: Create a Traffic Manager profile using the Azure portal](/azure/traffic-manager/quickstart-create-traffic-manager-profile). You just need the following sections: [Create a Traffic Manager profile](/azure/traffic-manager/quickstart-create-traffic-manager-profile#create-a-traffic-manager-profile) and [Add Traffic Manager endpoints](/azure/traffic-manager/quickstart-create-traffic-manager-profile#add-traffic-manager-endpoints). Use the following steps as you go through these sections, then return to this article after you create and configure the Azure Traffic Manager:

1. When you reach the section [Create a Traffic Manager profile](/azure/traffic-manager/quickstart-create-traffic-manager-profile#create-a-traffic-manager-profile), in step 2, for **Create Traffic Manager profile**, use the following steps:
   1. For **Name**, enter a unique Traffic Manager profile name - for example, `tmprofile-mjg032524`.
   1. For **Routing method**, select **Priority**.
   1. For **Resource group**, enter and save aside the new resource group name - for example, `myResourceGroupTM1`.

1. When you reach the section [Add Traffic Manager endpoints](/azure/traffic-manager/quickstart-create-traffic-manager-profile#add-traffic-manager-endpoints), use the following steps:
   1. After you open the Traffic Manager profile in step 2, in the **Configuration** page, use the following steps:
      1. For **DNS time to live (TTL)**, enter *10*.
      1. Under **Endpoint monitor settings**, for **Protocol**, select **https**, and for **Port**, enter *443*.
      1. Under **Fast endpoint failover settings**, use the following values:
         - For **Probing internal**, select **10**.
         - For **Tolerated number of failures**, enter *3*.
         - For **Probe timeout**, enter *5*.
      1. Select **Save**. Wait until it completes.
   1. In step 4 for adding the primary endpoint `myPrimaryEndpoint`, use the following steps:
      1. For **Target resource type**, select **Public IP address**.
      1. Select the **Choose public IP address** dropdown and enter the name of the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway in the East US region that you saved aside previously. You should see one entry matched. Select it for **Public IP address**.
   1. In step 6 for adding a failover/secondary endpoint `myFailoverEndpoint`, use the following steps:
      1. For **Target resource type**, select **Public IP address**.
      1. Select the **Choose public IP address** dropdown and enter the name of the public IP address of the Azure Application Gateway in the West US region that you saved aside previously. You should see one entry matched. Select it for **Public IP address**.
   1. Wait for a while. Select **Refresh** until the **Monitor status** for endpoint `myPrimaryEndpoint` is **Online** and **Monitor status** for endpoint `myFailoverEndpoint` is **Degraded**.

Next, use the following steps to verify that the sample app deployed to the primary cluster is accessible from the Traffic Manager profile:

1. Select **Overview** of the Traffic Manager profile you created.
1. Check and copy down the DNS name of the Traffic Manager profile, replacing the protocol `http` with `https`. For example, `https://tmprofile-mjg032524.trafficmanager.net`.
1. Open the URL in a new browser tab. You should see that the coffee you created previously is listed in the page.
1. Create another coffee with a different name and price - for example, *Coffee 2* with price *20* - which is persisted into both the application data table and the session table of the database. The UI that you see should be similar to the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/sample-app-ui-2nd-coffee.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sample application UI with the second coffee." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/sample-app-ui-2nd-coffee.png":::

If your UI doesn't look similar, troubleshoot and resolve the problem before you continue. Keep the console open and use it for the failover test later.

You've completed the Traffic Manager profile setup. Keep the page open and you use it for monitoring the endpoint status change in a failover event later.

## Test failover from primary to secondary

In this section, to test failover, you manually failover your Azure SQL Database server and restore the backup of your AKS cluster, and then fail back using the Azure portal.

### Failover to the secondary site

To simulate an outage of the primary region, stop the primary AKS cluster by following the steps in [Stop and start an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](/azure/aks/start-stop-cluster).

Next, start the secondary AKS cluster so it can be restored from the backup of the primary cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty applications running on the restore target cluster, to avoid conflicts, use the following steps to clean up WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty applications:
>
> * Connect to the target cluster by running the command for `cmdToConnectToCluster` that you saved aside previously.
> * For Open Liberty applications, run the following command:
>
>   ```bash
>   kubectl delete OpenLibertyApplication --all --all-namespaces
>   ```
>
> * For WebSphere Liberty applications, run the following command:
>
>   ```bash
>   kubectl delete WebSphereLibertyApplication --all --all-namespaces
>   ```

Then, switch to the browser tab of your Traffic Manager profile, and verify that the **Monitor status** for both endpoints `myPrimaryEndpoint` and `myFailoverEndpoint` is **Degraded**.

Now, use the following steps to failover the Azure SQL Database from the primary server to the secondary server:

1. Switch to the browser tab of your Azure SQL Database failover group - for example, `failovergroup-mjg032524`.
1. Select **Failover**, then select **Yes**.
1. Wait until it completes.

Next, use the following steps to restore the backup of the primary AKS cluster to the secondary AKS cluster:

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, enter *Backup center* and select **Backup center** from the search results.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Backup instances**. Filter on the datasource type **Kubernetes Services**. Find the backup instance you created in the previous section - for example, `<aks-cluster-name>\akseastusmjg032524`.
1. Select the backup instance.
1. Select **Restore**.
1. On the **Restore** page, the default pane is **Restore point**. Select **Previous** to change to the **Basics** pane. For **Restore Region**, select **Secondary Region**, then select **Next: Restore point**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-restore-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Restore Basics pane." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-restore-basics.png":::

1. In the **Restore point** pane, the latest **Operational and Vault-standard** restore point is selected. Keep the defaults and select **Next: Restore parameters**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-restore-restorepoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Restore point pane." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-restore-restorepoint.png":::

1. On the **Restore parameters** pane, use the following steps:

   1. For **Select Target cluster**, select the secondary AKS cluster that you created in the West US region. You run into a permission issue as shown in the following screenshot. Select **Grant Permission** to mitigate the errors.
   1. For **Backup Staging Location**, select the Storage Account that you created in the West US region. You run into a permission issue as shown in the following screenshot. Select **Assign missing roles** to mitigate the errors.

      :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-restore-restoreparameters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Restore parameters pane." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-instance-restore-restoreparameters.png":::

   1. If the errors still happen after the role assignments finish, select **Revalidate** to refresh the permissions.

   1. When granting missing permissions, if asked to specify a **Scope**, accept the default value.

   1. Select **Validate**. You should see the message, `Validation completed successfully`. Otherwise, troubleshoot and resolve the problem before you continue.

1. Select **Next: Review + restore**. Then select **Restore**. It takes about 10 minutes to restore the cluster.

1. You can monitor the restore process from **Backup center** > **Monitoring + reporting** > **Backup jobs**, as shown in the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-restore-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows a CrossRegionRestore in progress." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/backup-restore-progress.png":::

1. Wait for a while, then select **Refresh**. Repeat the operation until you see that **Status** becomes **Completed**.

Then, use the following steps to verify that the restore works as expected:

1. Switch to the terminal where you connected to the secondary AKS cluster.
1. Run the following command to get the sample app restored from the backup:

   ```bash
   kubectl get OpenLibertyApplication
   ```

   You should see one **READY** application in the output:

   ```output
   NAME                       IMAGE                                 EXPOSED   RECONCILED   RESOURCESREADY   READY   AGE
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic   acr3984d1.azurecr.io/javaee-cafe:v1             True         True             True    3m
   ```

1. Run the following command to get status of the pods created during the deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   You should see three **Running** pods in the output:

   ```output
   NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic-7bb57dd945-6ljll   1/1     Running   0          3m
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic-7bb57dd945-h2xdf   1/1     Running   0          3m
   javaee-cafe-cluster-agic-7bb57dd945-k744w   1/1     Running   0          3m
   ```

1. Switch to the browser tab of your Traffic Manager profile, then refresh the page until you see that **Monitor status** for endpoint `myFailoverEndpoint` is **Online** and **Monitor status** for endpoint `myPrimaryEndpoint` is **Degraded**.

1. Switch to the browser tab with the DNS name of the Traffic Manager profile - for example, `https://tmprofile-mjg032524.trafficmanager.net`. Refresh the page and you should see the same data persisted in the application data table and the session table displayed. The UI that you see should be similar to the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/sample-app-ui-after-failover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sample application UI after failover." lightbox="media/migrate-liberty-to-aks-with-ha-dr/sample-app-ui-after-failover.png":::

   If you don't observe this behavior, it might be because the Traffic Manager is taking time to update DNS to point to the failover site. The problem could also be that your browser cached the DNS name resolution result that points to the failed site. Wait for a while and refresh the page again.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The app configures [session timeout](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks/blob/20240325/java-app/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml#L29-L31) as 1 hour. Depending on how much time it took to failover, you might not see session data displayed in the **New coffee** section of the sample app UI if it expired more than one hour previously.

### Re-protect the failover site

Now that the secondary region is the failover site and is active, you should re-protect it with Azure Backup.

First, use the same steps in the section [Back up the AKS cluster](#back-up-the-aks-cluster) to back up the secondary AKS cluster, except for the following differences:

1. For **Create a Backup vault**, use the following steps:
   1. For **Resource group**, select the existing resource group deployed in the secondary region - for example, `liberty-aks-westus-mjg032524`.
   1. For **Backup vault name**, enter a unique value  - for example, `aks-backup-vault-westus-mjg032524`.
   1. For **Region**, select **West US**.
1. For **Create a backup policy**, use the following steps:
   1. Select the Backup vault you created in the secondary region - for example, `aks-backup-vault-westus-mjg032524`.
1. For **Configure backups**, use the following steps:
   1. Select the Backup vault you created in the secondary region - for example, `aks-backup-vault-westus-mjg032524`.
   1. For **Backup Instance** name, fill in a unique name - for example, `akswestusmjg032524`.

Then, use the same steps in the section [Wait for a Vault-standard backup to happen](#wait-for-a-vault-standard-backup-to-happen) to wait until a Vault-standard backup of the secondary AKS cluster is available, except select the backup instance from the **Backup** page of the secondary AKS cluster.

### Fail back to the primary site

Use the same steps in the [Failover to the secondary site](#failover-to-the-secondary-site) section to fail back to the primary site including database server and the AKS cluster, except for the following differences:

1. When you prepare for the failback, use the following steps:
   1. Stop the secondary AKS cluster to simulate an outage of the secondary region.
   1. Start the primary AKS cluster.
   1. Connect to the primary AKS cluster and clean up WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty applications.

1. When you restore the backup of the secondary AKS cluster to the primary AKS cluster, use the following steps:
   1. Select the backup instance in the secondary region - for example, `<aks-cluster-name>\akswestusmjg032524`.
   1. In the **Restore parameters** pane, use the following steps:
      1. For **Select Target cluster**, select the primary AKS cluster that you created in the East US region.
      1. For **Backup Staging Location**, select the Storage Account that you created in the East US region.

1. When you verify that the restore works as expected, use the following steps:
   1. Switch to the terminal where you connected to the primary AKS cluster, and check that the app is restored successfully.
   1. Switch to the browser tab of your Traffic Manager profile, then refresh the page until you see that **Monitor status** for endpoint `myPrimaryEndpoint` is **Online** and **Monitor status** for endpoint `myFailoverEndpoint` is **Degraded**.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use the WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty clusters and other components, use the following steps to delete the resource groups to clean up the resources used in this tutorial:

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, enter the resource group name of Azure SQL Database servers - for example, `myResourceGroup` - and select the matched resource group from the search results.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. In **Enter resource group name to confirm deletion**, enter the resource group name.
1. Select **Delete**.
1. Repeat steps 1-4 for the resource group of the Traffic Manager - for example, `myResourceGroupTM1`.
1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, enter *Backup vaults* and select **Backup vaults** from the search results. You should see two Backup vaults listed - for example, `aks-backup-vault-eastus-mjg032524` and `aks-backup-vault-westus-mjg032524`. For each of them, use the following steps:
   1. Select to open the Backup vault.
   1. Select **Manage** > **Properties** > **Soft delete** > **Update**. Next to **Enable soft Delete**, unselect the checkbox, and then select **Update**.
   1. Select **Manage** > **Backup instances**. Filter on the datasource type **Kubernetes Services**. Select the instance you created and then delete it.
1. Wait until the two Backup instances are deleted.
1. Repeat steps 1-4 for the resource group of the primary cluster - for example, `liberty-aks-eastus-mjg032524`.
1. Repeat steps 1-4 for the resource group of the secondary cluster - for example, `liberty-aks-westus-mjg032524`.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you set up a WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty HA/DR solution consisting of an active-passive application infrastructure tier with an active-passive database tier, and in which both tiers span two geographically different sites. At the first site, both the application infrastructure tier and the database tier are active. At the second site, the secondary domain is restored with Azure Backup, and the secondary database is on standby.
