# Migrate JBoss EAP applications to WildFly on Azure Kubernetes Service

This guide describes what you should be aware of when you want to migrate an existing JBoss EAP application to run on WildFly in an Azure Kubernetes Service container.

## Pre-migration

To ensure a successful migration, before you start, complete the assessment and inventory steps described in the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [inventory-server-capacity-aks](includes/inventory-server-capacity-aks.md)]

### Inventory all secrets

Check all properties and configuration files on the production server(s) for any secrets and passwords. Be sure to check *jboss-web.xml* in your WARs. Configuration files that contain passwords or credentials may also be found inside your application.

Consider storing those secrets in Azure KeyVault. For more information, see [Azure Key Vault basic concepts](/azure/key-vault/basic-concepts).

[!INCLUDE [validate-that-the-supported-java-version-works-correctly-wildfly](includes/validate-that-the-supported-java-version-works-correctly-wildfly.md)]

### Inventory JNDI resources

Inventory all JNDI resources. Some, such as JMS message brokers, may require migration or reconfiguration.

### Determine whether session replication is used

If your application relies on session replication, you'll have to change your application to remove this dependency.

#### Inside your application

Inspect the *WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml* and/or *WEB-INF/web.xml* files.

### Document datasources

If your application uses any databases, you need to capture the following information:

* What is the datasource name?
* What is the connection pool configuration?
* Where can I find the JDBC driver JAR file?

For more information, see [About JBoss EAP Datasources](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.3/html/configuration_guide/datasource_management) in the JBoss EAP documentation.

### Determine whether and how the file system is used

Any usage of the file system on the application server will require reconfiguration or, in rare cases, architectural changes. File system may be used by JBoss EAP modules or by your application code. You may identify some or all of the scenarios described in the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [static-content](includes/static-content.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dynamic-or-internal-content-aks](includes/dynamic-or-internal-content-aks.md)]

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-your-application-relies-on-scheduled-jobs](includes/determine-whether-your-application-relies-on-scheduled-jobs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-a-connection-to-on-premises-is-needed](includes/determine-whether-a-connection-to-on-premises-is-needed.md)]

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-jms-queues-or-topics-are-in-use](includes/determine-whether-jms-queues-or-topics-are-in-use.md)]

### Determine whether your application uses JBoss-EAP-specific APIs

If your application uses JBoss-EAP-specific APIs, you'll need to refactor it to remove those dependencies.

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-your-application-contains-os-specific-code](includes/determine-whether-your-application-contains-os-specific-code.md)]

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-ejb-timers-are-in-use](includes/determine-whether-ejb-timers-are-in-use.md)]

### Determine whether JCA connectors are in use

If your application uses JCA connectors, validate that you can use the JCA connector on WildFly. If the JCA implementation is tied to JBoss EAP, you must refactor your application to remove that dependency. If you can use the JCA connector on WildFly, then for it to be available, you must add the JARs to the server classpath and put the necessary configuration files in the correct location in the WildFly server directories.

[!INCLUDE [determine-whether-your-application-is-composed-of-multiple-wars](includes/determine-whether-your-application-is-composed-of-multiple-wars.md)]

### Determine whether your application is packaged as an EAR

If your application is packaged as an EAR file, be sure to examine the *application.xml* file and capture the configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to be able to scale each of your web applications independently for better use of your AKS resources you should break up the EAR into separate web applications.

[!INCLUDE [deploy-to-aks](includes/deploy-to-aks.md)]

### Configure persistent storage

If your application requires non-volatile storage, configure one or more [Persistent Volumes](/azure/aks/azure-disks-dynamic-pv).

## Post-migration

Now that you've migrated your application to Azure Kubernetes Service, you should verify that it works as you expect. After you've done that, we have some recommendations for you that can make your application more cloud-native.
