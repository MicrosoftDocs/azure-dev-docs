# Tutorial: Migrate Oracle WebLogic Server to Azure Kubernetes Service within a custom virtual network

This tutorial shows you how to deploy the Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offer that integrates with a custom virtual network in the consumer's subscription. The WLS on AKS offer lets you decide whether to create a new virtual network or use an existing one.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create a custom virtual network and create the infrastructure within the network.
> - Run Oracle WebLogic Server on AKS in the custom virtual network.
> - Expose Oracle WebLogic Server with Azure Application Gateway as a load balancer.
> - Validate successful deployment.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
- Prepare a local machine with Unix-like operating system installed - for example, Ubuntu, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux.
- [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) 2.37.0 or above to run Azure CLI commands.
  - Sign in with Azure CLI by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. See [Sign into Azure with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli#sign-into-azure-with-azure-cli) for other sign-in options.
  - When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).
  - Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).
- The WLS on AKS marketplace offer requires permission to create user-assign managed identity and assign Azure roles. To assign Azure roles, you must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).
- An Oracle account. The steps in [Oracle Container Registry](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-ocr) will direct you to accept the license agreement for WebLogic Server images. Make note of your Oracle Account password and email.

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create). This example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `eastus` location:

```azurecli
export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="myResourceGroup"
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --location eastus
```

## Create a custom virtual network

There are constraints when creating a custom virtual network. Before you create the virtual network in your environment, read the following articles:

- [Network concepts for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/concepts-network).
- [Application Gateway infrastructure configuration](/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure).

The example in this section creates a virtual network with address space `192.168.0.0/16`, and creates two subnets used for AKS and Application Gateway.

First, create a virtual network by using [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet#az-network-vnet-create). The following example creates a default virtual network named `myVNet`:

```azurecli
az network vnet create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --name myVNet \
    --address-prefixes 192.168.0.0/16
```

Next, create a subnet by using [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#az-network-vnet-subnet-create) for the AKS cluster. The following example creates a subnet named `myAKSSubnet`:

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --name myAKSSubnet \
    --vnet-name myVNet \
    --address-prefixes 192.168.1.0/24
```

Next, create a subnet by using [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#az-network-vnet-subnet-create) for Application Gateway. The following example creates a subnet named `myAppGatewaySubnet`:

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --name myAppGatewaySubnet \
    --vnet-name myVNet \
    --address-prefixes 192.168.2.0/24
```

Next, use the following command to get the AKS subnet resource ID and store it in a variable for use later in this article:

```azurecli
export AKS_SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --vnet-name myVNet \
    --name myAKSSubnet \
    --query id \
    --output tsv)
```

## Create an AKS cluster in the virtual network

Use the following command to create an AKS cluster in your virtual network and subnet by using the [az aks create](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command.

> [!NOTE]
> This example creates an AKS cluster using *kubenet* and a system-assigned identity. Azure CLI will grant [Network Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) role to the system-assigned identity after the cluster is created.
>
> If you want to use *Azure CNI*, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) to create an *Azure CNI* enabled AKS cluster.
>
> If you want to use a user-assigned managed identity, see [Create an AKS cluster with system-assigned managed identities](/azure/aks/configure-kubenet#create-an-aks-cluster-with-user-assigned-managed-identities).

```azurecli
az aks create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --node-count 3 \
    --network-plugin kubenet \
    --vnet-subnet-id $AKS_SUBNET_ID \
    --yes
```

## Store Java EE applications in a Storage account

You can deploy a Java EE Application along with the WLS on AKS offer deployment. You have to upload the application file (*.war*, *.ear*, or *.jar*) to a pre-existing Azure Storage Account and Storage Container within that account.

Create an Azure Storage Account using the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) command, as shown in the following example:

```azurecli
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="stgwlsaks$(date +%s)"
az storage account create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
    --location eastus \
    --sku Standard_RAGRS \
    --kind StorageV2
```

Create a container for storing blobs with the [az storage container create](/cli/azure/storage/container#az-storage-container-create) command. The following example uses the storage account key to authorize the operation to create the container. You can also use your Microsoft Entra account to authorize the operation to create the container. For more information, see [Authorize access to blob or queue data with Azure CLI](/azure/storage/blobs/authorize-data-operations-cli).

```azurecli
export KEY=$(az storage account keys list \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
    --query [0].value \
    --output tsv)

az storage container create \
    --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
    --name mycontainer \
    --account-key ${KEY} \
    --auth-mode key
```

Next, upload your Java EE application to a blob using the [az storage blob upload](/cli/azure/storage/blob#az-storage-blob-upload) command. The following example uploads the [testwebapp.war](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-testwebapp) test application.

```azurecli
curl -fsL https://aka.ms/wls-aks-testwebapp -o testwebapp.war

az storage blob upload \
    --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
    --container-name mycontainer \
    --name testwebapp.war \
    --file testwebapp.war \
    --account-key ${KEY} \
    --auth-mode key
```

To upload multiple files at the same time, see [Create, download, and list blobs with Azure CLI](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli).

## Deploy WLS on the AKS offer

This section shows you how to provision a WLS cluster with the AKS instance you created previously. You'll provision the cluster within the custom virtual network and export cluster nodes using Azure Application Gateway as the load balancer. The offer will automatically generate a self-signed certificate for Application Gateway TLS/SSL termination. For advanced usage of TLS/SSL termination with Application Gateway, see [Application Gateway Ingress Controller](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-app-gateway-ic).

First, begin the process of deploying a WebLogic Server as described in [Oracle WebLogic Server on AKS user guide](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-docs), but come back to this page when you reach **Configure AKS cluster**, as shown in the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="media/migrate-weblogic-to-aks-within-existing-vnet/configure-aks-cluster.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the Configure AKS cluster pane of the Create Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure Kubernetes Service page." lightbox="media/migrate-weblogic-to-aks-within-existing-vnet/configure-aks-cluster.png":::

### Configure the AKS cluster

Now that you have an AKS cluster within the virtual network, select the AKS cluster for the deployment.

1. For **Create a new AKS cluster?**, select **No**.
1. Under **Select AKS cluster**, open the dropdown menu, then select the AKS cluster you created, named `myAKSCluster` in this example.
1. For **Use a pre-existing, WebLogic Server Docker image from Oracle Container Registry?**, select **Yes**.
1. For **Create a new Azure Container Registry to store application images?**, select **Yes**.
1. Under **Username for Oracle Single Sign-on authentication**, input your Oracle single sign-on account user name.
1. Under **Password for Oracle Single Sign-on authentication**, input the password for that account.
1. Under **Confirm password**, reenter the value of the preceding field.
1. For **Select desired combination of WebLogic Server, JDK and Operator System or fully qualified Docker tag**, keep the default value.
1. For **Deploy your application package**, select **Yes**.
1. For **Application package (.war,.ear,.jar)**, select **Browse**.
   - Select the storage account you created. The name starts with `stgwlsaks` in this example.
   - Select your container in **Containers** page. This example uses `mycontainer`.
   - Check your application listed in the container. This example uses *testwebapp.war*.
   - Select **Select**.
1. For other fields, keep the default values.

You've now finished configuring the AKS cluster, WebLogic base image, and Java EE application.

Next, you'll configure end-to-end TLS/SSL to WebLogic Server Administration Console and cluster on HTTPS (Secure) port, with your own certificate in **TLS/SSL Configuration** pane. For this task, follow the steps in the [Oracle WebLogic Server on AKS user guide](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-docs), but come back to this page when you reach **Networking**, as shown in the following screenshot. You'll use the next section to configure the networking, then return to the WLS on AKS user guide to complete the deployment.

:::image type="content" source="media/migrate-weblogic-to-aks-within-existing-vnet/networking-agic-custom-vnet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing the Networking pane of the Create Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure Kubernetes Service page." lightbox="media/migrate-weblogic-to-aks-within-existing-vnet/networking-agic-custom-vnet.png":::

### Configure Application Gateway Ingress Controller

Use the following steps to configure Application Gateway Ingress Controller within the virtual network.

1. For **Connect to Azure Application Gateway?**, select **Yes**.
1. Under **Configure virtual networks**, for **Virtual network**, select the virtual network you created. This example uses `myVNet` in `myResourceGroup`. For **Subnet**, select the subnet for Application Gateway. This example uses `myAppGatewaySubnet`.
1. For **Select desired TLS/SSL certificate option**, select **Generate a self-signed front-end certificate**.
1. For **Create ingress for Administration Console**, select **Yes** to expose the WebLogic Administration Console.
1. For the other fields, keep the default values.

You can now continue with the other aspects of the WLS deployment as described in the [Oracle WebLogic Server on AKS user guide](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-docs).

## Validate successful deployment of WLS

This section shows you how to quickly validate the successful deployment of the WLS cluster and Application Gateway Ingress Controller.

After the deployment completes, select **Outputs**. You'll find the external URL of the WebLogic Administration Console and the cluster. Use the following instructions to access these resources:

- To view the WebLogic Administration Console, first copy the value of the output variable `adminConsoleExternalUrl`. Next, paste the value into your browser address bar and press **Enter** to open the sign-in page of the WebLogic Administration Console.
- To view the WebLogic cluster, first copy the value of the output variable `clusterExternalUrl`. Next, use this value to construct the sample application URL by applying it to the following template: `${clusterExternalUrl}testwebapp/`. Now paste the application URL into your browser address bar and press **Enter**. You'll find that the sample application shows the private address and hostname of the pod that the Application Gateway Ingress Controller is routing to.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use the WLS cluster, delete the virtual network and the WLS Cluster with the following Azure portal steps:

1. Visit the overview page for the resource group `myResourceGroup`, then select **Delete resource group**.
1. Visit the overview page for the resource group that you deployed the WLS on AKS offer, then select **Delete resource group**.

## Next steps

Continue to explore options to run WLS on Azure.
