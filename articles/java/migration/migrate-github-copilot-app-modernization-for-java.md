# GitHub Copilot app modernization

Enterprises often deal with technical debt throughout their development cycles, and upgrading Java runtimes, frameworks, and dependencies is a common but resource-intensive task. At the same time, many organizations aim to migrate and modernize their application estate to the cloud, which involves:

- Assessing the current state of code, configuration, and dependencies
- Planning Azure resources
- Remediating issues to enable successful migration

**GitHub Copilot app modernization** is an AI assistant that delivers end-to-end support for application modernization. Built on **GitHub Copilot agent mode**, it offers predefined tasks for common upgrade and migration scenarios while incorporating industry best practices for running applications on Azure. At the same time, it enables teams to infuse their own coding standards, organizational policies, and existing practices into the modernization process.

**Key Capabilities at a Glance**

- **Application Assessment and Planning** – Analyze code, configuration, and dependencies. Visualize every task in the modernization process, from assessment to deployment.
- **Code Transformations** – Suggest and apply code remediation for upgrade and migration scenarios.
- **Build, Patching and Tests** – Verify the project builds successfully after remediation, and apply fixes when needed, perform Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) checks to reduce exposure to security vulnerabilities, and migrate existing and generate new unit tests to validate modernization outcomes and improve test coverage.
- **Containerization and Deployment** – Generate Dockerfiles for app containerization, and other artifacts to automate deployment to Azure.

App Mod integrates **GitHub Copilot's AI-powered capabilities** with open-source tools like **OpenRewrite** to automate complex upgrade steps. It supports both **Maven** and **Gradle** projects and targets upgrades between **Java versions 8, 11, 17, and 21**. The tool has a particular focus on modernizing applications that use the **Spring Boot** framework. The upgrade process keeps you in control and ensures transparency by displaying all logs and outputs.

Start your migration journey with **App Assessments** to get an overview of cloud readiness migration issues, including:

- Instructions for setting up Azure resources
- Recommendations on following best practices
- Recommendations for changing your application code

In scenarios where code changes are required, App Modernization guides you through the remediation step. At this stage, you can use predefined tasks for common issues, such as:

- Switching from password-based authentication to managed identities
- Moving from Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 to Azure Blob Storage

To learn more about predefined tasks available in App Modernization today, see [predefined tasks](migrate-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-java-predefined-tasks.md).

When it comes to development, enterprises often have strict processes and controls. This is where [customer-defined tasks](migrate-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-java-quickstart-create-and-apply-your-own-task) come in.

Customer-defined tasks are automatically generated by analyzing code commits from previously migrated applications. These tasks serve as remediation guides for similar issues in other apps, enabling Copilot to apply proven patterns across multiple codebases. With each successful migration, the knowledge base expands—accelerating future remediations and reducing manual effort

GitHub Copilot app modernization also includes specialized agents to:

- Verify your app builds successfully
- Reduce technical debt by addressing CVEs
- Validate behavioral integrity with unit tests

See [use-specific Java utilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/upgrade/tools) for details.

Modernization isn't just about upgrading code—it's about preparing your applications for the cloud. Whether you're targeting Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or AKS Automatic, Copilot helps you get there faster and with confidence.

A process that once took **months** can now be completed in just **days**, thanks to automated app modernization capability powered by GitHub Copilot!
