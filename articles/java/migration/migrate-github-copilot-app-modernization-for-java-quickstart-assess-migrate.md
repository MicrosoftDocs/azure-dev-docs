# Quickstart: assess and migrate a Java project using GitHub Copilot App Modernization for Java

This quickstart shows you how to use GitHub Copilot App Modernization for Java to assess and migrate a Java project. In this quickstart, you install and configure the extension, then assess and migrate a sample project. For example, you use a predefined task to update an Azure SQL database connection to use Azure Managed Identity instead of a username and password.

The following video demonstrates how GitHub Copilot App Modernization for Java uses [AppCAT](/azure/migrate/appcat/java) to help assess a Java project for migration to Azure:

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) enabled. A Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plan is required.
- The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Must be version 1.101 or later.
- The latest version of the [GitHub Copilot extension in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview).
- [GitHub Copilot app modernization for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.migrate-java-to-azure).
- [Java 21](/java/openjdk/download) or later.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) to build Java projects.


## Sign in to use Copilot and then install App Modernization

To use GitHub Copilot, sign in to your GitHub account in Visual Studio Code. Select the Copilot icon at the top of Visual Studio Code to access the GitHub Copilot pane. For more information about setting up GitHub Copilot, see [Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).

Then, use the following steps to install GitHub Copilot App Modernization for Java:

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Extensions** view from the Activity Bar.
1. Search for **GitHub Copilot App Modernization** in the marketplace.
1. Select the **GitHub Copilot App Modernization for Java** extension or the **GitHub Copilot App Modernization** extension pack.
1. On the extension page, select **Install**.
1. Restart Visual Studio Code.

After installation completes, you should see a notification in the corner of Visual Studio Code confirming success.

For more information, see [Install a VS Code extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/extensions#_install-a-vs-code-extension).

## Upgrade JDK and dependencies version
Here are 2 ways to upgrade JDK version:
On the sidebar, select the **Github Copilot app modernization for Java** pane, one way is to click **Upgrade Runtime & Frameworks** in the **QUICKSTART** section, another is to run **Upgraded Java Runtime** task in the **TASKS - Upgrade Tasks** section. See [Quickstart: upgrade a Java project with GitHub Copilot App Modernization - upgrade for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/upgrade/quickstart-upgrade) for more information.

Use the following steps to upgrade Spring framework or third-party dependency:
Run **Upgrade Java Framework** task in the **TASKS - Upgrade Tasks** section. See [Upgrade a framework or third-party dependency by using GitHub Copilot App Modernization â€“ upgrade for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/upgrade/framework-upgrade) for more information.

## Assess cloud readiness

Use the following steps to start your migration process with solution assessment. This assessment helps you understand what your cloud readiness challenges are and how impactful they are, provides recommended solutions. A solution recommendation includes references to set up Azure resources, add configurations, and make code changes.

1. Clone the [Java migration copilot samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples) repository and then check out to the **source** branch.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **mi-sql-public-demo** project folder in the samples repository.

1. On the sidebar, select the **Github Copilot app modernization for Java** pane, you can click **Migrate to Azure** button or click **Run Assessment** in the **ASSESSMENT** section.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/migrate-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-java/run-assessment.png" lightbox="./media/migrate-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-java/run-assessment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code that shows how to generate assessment report.":::

   The GitHub Copilot chat window with agent mode is opened to call the modernization assessor to execute the App Modernization assessment.

1. Select **Continue** to confirm.

The modernization assessor now opens **assessment.md**. This file is the configuration for running AppCAT, which performs the app assessment. AppCAT asks for your confirmation to continue. You can examine its content and make changes there, if necessary.

The modernization assessor verifies your local environment first. If the AppCAT and its dependencies aren't installed, agent will help to install. After installation, it calls AppCAT to assess the current project. This step could take several minutes to complete.

Upon completion of the analysis, the modernization assessor produces a categorized view of cloud readiness issues in an opened summary report.

When reviewing the summary report, you can select **Migrate to Azure SQL Database (Spring)** from the solution list under the issue **"Database Migration (Microsoft SQL)"**. Then, select **Migrate** to move to the code remediation stage.

## Apply a predefined task

The migration Copilot provides predefined tasks for common migration scenarios that you might face when migrating to Azure. For example, with the **mi-sql-public-demo** sample, the Database Migration (Microsoft SQL) tasks change the Azure SQL database connection to use Azure Managed Identity instead of a username and password.

1. In the **Assessment Report**, select **Migrate**. The Copilot chat window opens with Agent Mode.

1. Select **Continue** repeatedly to confirm each tool action in the Copilot Chat window. The Copilot agent uses various tools for App Modernization and each tool requires confirmation to proceed.

1. After each step, manually input **continue** to confirm and proceed.

1. Wait for the code changes to be generated.

## Validation Iteration

After migration, manually input **continue** to proceed build validation. It includes four steps:

### Apply the Validate-CVEs tool

1. This tool attempts to detected CVEs in current dependencies and fix them.

### Apply the Build-Project tool

1. This tool attempts to resolve any build errors in up to 10 iterations.

### Apply the Consistency-Validation tool

1. This tool analyzes the codes for functional consistency.

### Apply the Run-Test tool

1. This tool analyzes the project for unit test failures and automatically generates a plan to fix them.

1. The Run-Test tool iteratively runs unit tests and fixes any failures in up to 10 iterations.

1. After all processes completes, review the code changes and confirm them by selecting **Keep**.

## Apply a Quality & Security Task

### Scan & Resolve CVEs
1. On the sidebar, select the **Github Copilot app modernization for Java** pane, open **Quality & Security Tasks** in the **TASKS** section and click **Scan & Resolve CVEs**.

1. This task will scan for vulnerabilities for these dependencies and get recommended fix versions. Its function is consistent with Validate CVEs tool.

### Generate Unit Test Cases
1. On the sidebar, select the **Github Copilot app modernization for Java** pane, open **Quality & Security Tasks** in the **TASKS** section and click **Generate Unit Test Cases**.

1. Then it will start generate unit tests and create a **TestReport** to show test results before and after generation. See [Quickstart: generate unit tests with GitHub Copilot App Modernization - upgrade for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/upgrade/quickstart-unit-tests) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure
> [!NOTE]
> This step needs you open Docker Desktop to prepare container.

On the sidebar, select the **Github Copilot app modernization for Java** pane, open **Deployment Tasks** in the **TASKS** section and click **Deploy to Azure**.
This tool will help prepare Azure resources and push codes image to Azure. See .
