# Tutorial: Migrate Oracle WebLogic Server to AKS with KEDA scaler based on Prometheus Metrics

This tutorial shows you how to migrate Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and configure automatic horizontal scaling based on Prometheus metrics.

In this tutorial, you accomplish the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Learn which WebLogic application metrics you can export using WebLogic Monitoring Exporter.
> - Deploy and run a WebLogic applciation on AKS using an Azure marketplace offer.
> - Enable the Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus using an Azure marketplace offer.
> - Feed WLS metrics to an Azure Monitor workspace using an Azure marketplace offer.
> - Integrate Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) with an AKS cluster using an Azure marketplace offer.
> - Create a KEDA scaler based on Prometheus Metrics.
> - Validate the scaler configuration.

The following diagram illustrates the architecture you build:

The [Oracle WebLogic Server on AKS offer](https://aka.ms/wlsaks) runs a WLS operator and a WLS domain on AKS. The WLS operator manages a WLS domain deployed using a [model in image](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/samples/domains/model-in-image/) domain source type. To learn more about the WLS operator, see [Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes Operator](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/).

The WebLogic Monitoring Exporter scrapes WebLogic Server metrics and feeds them to Prometheus. The exporter uses the WebLogic Server 12.2.1.x [RESTful Management Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1221/wls/WLRUR/overview.htm#WLRUR111) for accessing runtime state and metrics.

The Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus collects and saves metrics from WLS at scale using a Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution, based on the [Prometheus](https://aka.ms/azureprometheus-promio) project from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. For more information, see [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview).

This article integrates KEDA with your AKS cluster to scale the WLS cluster based on Prometheus metrics from the Azure Monitor workspace. KEDA monitors the Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus and feeds that data to AKS and the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to drive rapid scaling of the WLS workload.

The following WLS state and metrics are exported by default. You can configure the exporter to export other metrics on demand. For a detailed description of WebLogic Monitoring Exporter configuration and usage, see [WebLogic Monitoring Exporter](https://blogs.oracle.com/weblogicserver/exporting-metrics-from-weblogic-server).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
- Make sure you have either the `Owner` role or the `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles in the subscription. You can verify the assignment by following the steps in [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal).
- Prepare a local machine with either Windows with WSL, GNU/Linux, or macOS installed.
- Install Azure CLI version 2.54.0 or higher to run Azure CLI commands.
- Install and set up [kubectl](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli).
- Install [cURL](https://curl.se/).
- Have the credentials for an Oracle single sign-on (SSO) account. To create one, see [Create Your Oracle Account](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-create-sso-account).
- Use the following steps to accept the license terms for WLS:
  1. Visit the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/) and sign in.
  1. If you have a support entitlement, select **Middleware**, then search for and select **weblogic_cpu**.
  1. If you don't have a support entitlement from Oracle, select **Middleware**, then search for and select **weblogic**.
  1. Accept the license agreement.

## Prepare the sample application

This article uses [testwebapp](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/tree/main/integration-tests/src/test/resources/apps/testwebapp) from the [weblogic-kubernetes-operator](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator) repository as a sample application.

Use the following commands to download the prebuilt sample app and expand it into a directory. Because this article writes several files, these commands create a top level directory to contain everything.

```bash
export BASE_DIR=$PWD/wlsaks
mkdir $BASE_DIR && cd $BASE_DIR
curl -L -o testwebapp.war https://aka.ms/wls-aks-testwebapp
unzip -d testwebapp testwebapp.war
```

### Modify the sample application

This article uses the metric `openSessionsCurrentCount` to scale up and scale down the WLS cluster. By default, the session timeout on WebLogic Server is 60 minutes. To observe the scaling down capability quickly, use the following steps to set a short timeout:

1. Use the following command to specify a session timeout of 150 seconds using `wls:timeout-secs`. The `HEREDOC` format is used to overwrite the file at *testwebapp/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml* with the desired content.

   ```xml
   cat <<EOF > testwebapp/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

   <wls:weblogic-web-app xmlns:wls="http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app http://xmlns.oracle.com/weblogic/weblogic-web-app/1.4/weblogic-web-app.xsd">
       <wls:weblogic-version>12.2.1</wls:weblogic-version>
       <wls:jsp-descriptor>
       <wls:keepgenerated>false</wls:keepgenerated>
       <wls:debug>false</wls:debug>
     </wls:jsp-descriptor>
     <wls:context-root>testwebapp</wls:context-root>
     <wls:session-descriptor>
       <wls:timeout-secs>150</wls:timeout-secs>
    </wls:session-descriptor>
   </wls:weblogic-web-app>
   EOF
   ```

1. Use the following command to rezip the sample app:

   ```bash
   cd testwebapp && zip -r ../testwebapp.war * && cd ..
   ```

### Create an Azure Storage account and upload the application

Use the following steps to create a storage account and container. Some of these steps direct you to other guides. After completing the steps, you can upload a sample application to deploy on WLS.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/publicportal).
1. Create a storage account by following the steps in [Create a storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create). Use the following specializations for the values in that article:
   - Create a new resource group for the storage account.
   - For **Region**, select **East US**.
   - For **Storage account name**, use the same value as the resource group name.
   - For **Performance**, select **Standard**.
   - The remaining tabs need no specializations.
1. Proceed to validate and create the account, then return to this article.
1. Create a storage container within the account by following the steps in the [Create a container](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container) section of [Quickstart: Upload, download, and list blobs with the Azure portal](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal).
1. In the same article, follow the steps in the [Upload a block blob](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#upload-a-block-blob) section to upload the *testwebapp.war* file. Then, return to this article.

## Deploy WLS on AKS using the Azure Marketplace offer

In this section, you create a WLS cluster on AKS using the Oracle [WebLogic Server on AKS](https://aka.ms/wlsaks) offer. The offer provides a full feature set for easily deploying WebLogic Server on AKS. This article focuses on the advanced dynamic scaling capabilities of the offer. For more information about the offer, see [Deploy a Java application with WebLogic Server on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](/azure/aks/howto-deploy-java-wls-app). For the complete reference documentation for the offer, see [the Oracle documentation](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-docs).

This offer implements the following choices for horizontal autoscaling:

- Kubernetes Metrics Server. This choice sets up all necessary configuration at deployment time. A horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) is deployed with a choice of metrics. You can further customize the HPA after deployment.

- WebLogic Monitoring Exporter. This choice automatically provisions WebLogic Monitoring Exporter, Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus, and KEDA. After the offer deployment completes, the WLS metrics are exported and saved in the Azure Monitor workspace. KEDA is installed with the ability to retrieve metrics from the Azure Monitor workspace.

  With this option, you must take more steps after deployment to complete the configuration.

This article describes the second option. Use the following steps to to complete the configuration:

1. Open the Oracle [WebLogic Server on AKS](https://aka.ms/wlsaks) offer in your browser and select **Create**. You should see the **Basics** pane of the offer.

1. Use the following steps to fill out the **Basics** pane:

   1. Ensure that the value shown for **Subscription** is the same one that has the roles listed in the prerequisites section.
   1. You must deploy the offer in an empty resource group. In the **Resource group** field, select **Create new** and fill in a unique value for the resource group - for example, *wlsaks-eastus-20240109*.
   1. Under **Instance details**, for **Region**, select **East US**.
   1. Under **Credentials WebLogic**, provide a password for **WebLogic Administrator** and **WebLogic Model encryption**, respectively. Save aside the username and password for **WebLogic Administrator**.
   1. Next to **Optional Basic Configuration**, select **No**.
   1. Under **Optional Basic Configuration**, set **Maximum dynamic cluster size** to 10. This value enables you to observe the autoscaling behavior.

1. Wait until **Running final validation...** successfully completes, then select **Create**. After a while, you should see the **Deployment** page where **Deployment is in progress** is displayed.

If you see any problems during **Running final validation...**, fix them and try again.

## Connect to the AKS cluster

The following sections require a terminal with `kubectl` installed to manage the WLS cluster. To install `kubectl` locally, use the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command.

Use the following steps to connect to the AKS cluster:

1. Open the Azure portal and go to the resource group that you provisioned in the [Deploy WLS on AKS using the Azure Marketplace offer](#deploy-wls-on-aks-using-the-azure-marketplace-offer) section.
1. Select the resource of type **Kubernetes service** from resource list.
1. Select **Connect**. Guidance to connect the AKS cluster appears.
1. Select **Azure CLI** and follow the steps to connect to the AKS cluster in your local terminal.

## Retrieve metrics from the Azure Monitor workspace

Use the following steps to see metrics in the Azure Monitor workspace using Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries:

1. In the Azure portal, view the resource group you used in the [Deploy WLS on AKS using the Azure Marketplace offer](#deploy-wls-on-aks-using-the-azure-marketplace-offer) section.
1. Select the resource of type **Azure Monitor workspace**.
1. Under **Managed Prometheus**, select **Prometheus explorer**.
1. Input `webapp_config_open_sessions_current_count` to query the current account of open sessions, as shown in the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="media/migrate-weblogic-to-aks-with-keda-scaler-based-on-prometheus-metrics/prometheus-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Prometheus explorer." lightbox="media/migrate-weblogic-to-aks-with-keda-scaler-based-on-prometheus-metrics/prometheus-explorer.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the following command to access the metrics by exposing the WebLogic Monitoring Exporter:
>
> ```bash
> cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: Service
> metadata:
>   name: sample-domain1-cluster-1-exporter
>   namespace: sample-domain1-ns
> spec:
>   ports:
>   - name: default
>     port: 8080
>     protocol: TCP
>     targetPort: 8080
>   selector:
>     weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain1
>     weblogic.clusterName: cluster-1
>   sessionAffinity: None
>   type: LoadBalancer
> EOF
>
> kubectl get svc -n sample-domain1-ns -w
> ```
>
> Wait for the `EXTERNAL-IP` column in the row for `sample-domain1-cluster-1-exporter` to switch from `<pending>` to an IP address. Then, open the URL `http://<exporter-public-ip>:8080/metrics` in a browser and sign in with the credentials you specified when deploying the offer. Here, you can find all the available metrics. You can input any of these in the PromQL window to display them in Azure Monitor. For example, `heap_free_percent` shows an interesting graph. To watch the memory pressure as the load is applied to the application, set **Auto refresh** and **Time range** to the smallest possible interval and leave the tab open.

## Create the KEDA scaler

Scalers define how and when KEDA should scale a deployment. This article uses the [Prometheus scaler](https://keda.sh/docs/2.10/scalers/prometheus/) to retrieve Prometheus metrics from the Azure Monitor workspace.

This article uses `openSessionsCurrentCount` as the trigger. The rule for this metric is described as follows. When the average open session count is more than 10, scale up the WLS cluster until it reaches the maximum replica size. Otherwise, scale down the WLS cluster until it reaches its minimum replica size. The following table lists the important parameters:

| Parameter name    | Value                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `serverAddress`   | The Query endpoint of your Azure Monitor workspace.                                                                               |
| `metricName`      | `webapp_config_open_sessions_current_count`                                                                                       |
| `query`           | `sum(webapp_config_open_sessions_current_count{app="app1"})`                                                                      |
| `threshold`       | 10                                                                                                                                |
| `minReplicaCount` | 1                                                                                                                                 |
| `maxReplicaCount` | The default value is 5. If you modified the maximum cluster size during offer deployment, replace with your maximum cluster size. |

Because you selected **WebLogic Monitoring Exporter** at deployment time, a KEDA scaler is ready to deploy. The following steps show you how to configure the KEDA scaler for use with your AKS cluster:

1. Open the Azure portal and go to the resource group that you provisioned in the [Deploy WLS on AKS using the Azure Marketplace offer](#deploy-wls-on-aks-using-the-azure-marketplace-offer) section.
1. In the navigation pane, in the **Settings** section, select **Deployments**. You see an ordered list of the deployments to this resource group, with the most recent one first.
1. Scroll to the oldest entry in this list. This entry corresponds to the deployment you started in the previous section. Select the oldest deployment, whose name starts with something similar to `oracle.20210620-wls-on-aks`.
1. Select **Outputs**. This option shows the list of outputs from the deployment.
1. The **kedaScalerServerAddress** value is the server address that saves the WLS metrics. KEDA is able to access and retrieve metrics from the address.
1. The **shellCmdtoOutputKedaScalerSample** value is the `base64` string of a scaler sample. Copy the value and run it in your terminal. The command should look similar to the following example:

   ```bash
   echo -e YXBpVm...XV0aAo= | base64 -d > scaler.yaml
   ```

   This command produces a *scaler.yaml* file in the current directory.

1. Modify the `metric:` and `query:` lines in *scaler.yaml* as shown in the following example:

   ```yaml
   metricName: webapp_config_open_sessions_current_count
   query: sum(webapp_config_open_sessions_current_count{app="app1"})
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you deploy an app with the offer, it's named `app1` by default. You can use the following steps to access the WLS admin console to obtain the application name:
   >
   > 1. Use the preceding steps to view the deployment outputs.
   > 1. The **adminConsoleExternalUrl** value is the fully qualified, public Internet visible link to the WLS admin consolt. Select the copy icon next to the field value to copy the link to your clipboard.
   > 1. Paste the value to your browser and open the WLS admin console.
   > 1. Sign in with the WLS admin account, which you saved aside during in the [Deploy WLS on AKS using the Azure Marketplace offer](#deploy-wls-on-aks-using-the-azure-marketplace-offer) section.
   > 1. Under **Domain Structure**, select **Deployments**. You find **app1** listed.
   > 1. Select **app1** to find that the **Name** value for the application is `app1`. Use `app1` as the application name in the query.

1. If desired, modify the `maxReplicaCount:` line in *scaler.yaml* as shown in the following example. It's an error to set this value higher than what you specified at deployment time on the **AKS** tab.

   ```yaml
   maxReplicaCount: 10
   ```

1. Use the following command to create the KEDA scaler rule by applying *scaler.yaml*:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f scaler.yaml
   ```

   It takes several minutes for KEDA to retrieve metrics from the Azure Monitor workspace. You can watch the scaler status by using the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa -n sample-domain1-ns -w
   ```

   After the scaler is ready to work, the output looks similar to the following content. The value in the `TARGETS` column switches from `<unknown>` to `0`.

   ```output
   NAME                                       REFERENCE                          TARGETS              MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
   keda-hpa-azure-managed-prometheus-scaler   Cluster/sample-domain1-cluster-1   0/10 (avg)           1         5         2          15s
   ```


## Test autoscaling

Now, you're ready to observe the autoscaling capability. This article opens new sessions using `curl` to access the application. After the average session count is larger than 10, the scaling-up action happens. The sessions last for 150 seconds, and the open session count decreases as the sessions expire. After the average session count is less than 10, the scaling-down action happens. Use the following steps to cause the scaling-up and scaling-down actions:

1. Use the following steps to obtain the application URL:

   1. Use the preceding steps to view the deployment outputs.
   1. The **clusterExternalUrl** value is the fully qualified, public, internet-visible link to the sample app deployed in WLS on this AKS cluster. To copy the link to your clipboard, select the copy icon next to the field value.
   1. The URL to access *testwebapp.war* is `${clusterExternalUrl}testwebapp` - for example, `http://wlsgw202403-wlsaks0314-domain1.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/testwebapp/`.

1. Run the `curl` command to access the application and cause new sessions. The following example opens 22 new sessions. The sessions are expired after 150 seconds. Replace the **WLS_CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_URL** value with yours.

   ```bash
   COUNTER=0
   MAXCURL=22
   WLS_CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_URL="http://wlsgw202403-wlsaks0314-domain1.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/"
   APP_URL="${WLS_CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_URL}testwebapp/"

   while [ $COUNTER -lt $MAXCURL ]; do curl ${APP_URL}; let COUNTER=COUNTER+1; sleep 1;done
   ```

1. In two separate shells, use the following commands:

   - Use the following command to observe the scaler:

     ```bash
     kubectl get hpa -n sample-domain1-ns -w
     ```

     This command produces output that looks similar to the following example:

     ```output
     $ kubectl get hpa -n sample-domain1-ns -w

     ```

   - In a separate shell, use the following command to observe the WLS pods:

     ```bash
     kubectl get pod -n sample-domain1-ns -w
     ```

     This command produces output that looks similar to the following example:

## Clean up resources

To avoid Azure charges, you should clean up unnecessary resources. When you no longer need the cluster, use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command. The following commands remove the resource group, container service, container registry, and all related resources:

```azurecli
az group delete --name <wls-resource-group-name> --yes --no-wait
az group delete --name <ama-resource-group-name> --yes --no-wait
```
