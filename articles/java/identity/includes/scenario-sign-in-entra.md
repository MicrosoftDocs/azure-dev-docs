The client app uses MSAL for Java (MSAL4J) to sign in users to their own Microsoft Entra ID tenant and obtain an [ID token](/entra/identity-platform/id-tokens) from Microsoft Entra ID. The ID token proves that a user is authenticated with this tenant. The app protects its routes according to the user's authentication status.
