> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **application.yml** file of the application currently holds the value of your client secret in the `client-secret` parameter. It isn't good practice to keep this value in this file. You might also be taking a risk if you commit the file to a Git repository. For the recommended approach, see [Manage secrets in Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/manage-secrets).
