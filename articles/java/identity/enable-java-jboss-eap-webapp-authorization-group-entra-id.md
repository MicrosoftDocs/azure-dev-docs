# Secure Java JBoss EAP apps using groups and group claims

This article shows you how to create a Java JBoss EAP app that signs in users with [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java). The app also restricts access to pages based on Microsoft Entra ID security group membership.
