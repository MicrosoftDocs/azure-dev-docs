# Azure tools for Java developers

This article describes common tools available for developers using Azure for Java.

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight but powerful code editor available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. VS Code supports a simple, modern Java development workflow through a set of extensions that provide project support, code completion, debugging, linting, and navigation.

## Eclipse and IntelliJ plugins

Manage Azure resources and deploy apps from your IDE with The Azure toolkits for [Eclipse](../toolkit-for-eclipse/index.yml) and [IntelliJ](../toolkit-for-intellij/index.yml).

## Apache Maven and Gradle plugins

Deploy Java applications to Azure with ease by configuring Azure plugins as part of your Maven or Gradle builds. Currently, the plugins support Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Azure Spring Apps.

- [Maven Archetypes for Azure Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-maven-archetypes)

## Supported Java runtimes

Java developers are free to use the distribution and version of Java of their choice for most Microsoft Azure and Azure Stack services. For more information, see [Java support on Azure and Azure Stack](java-support-on-azure.md).

## Azure CLI

The Azure CLI provides a command-line experience to manage Azure resources. You can use it in your browser with [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview), or you can [install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) it on macOS, Linux, and Windows and run it from the command line.
