# Install the JDK

You can use any JDK to build Java applications for Azure, although we recommend using the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](/java/openjdk/install).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Update June 30th, 2021:** Zulu for Azure no longer receives updates or support since January 1st, 2022. Azure services have transitioned to [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](/java/openjdk/install) for JDK 11 and [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) for JDK 8. For more information, see [End of Updates, Support and Availability of the Zulu for Azure builds of OpenJDK](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/end-of-updates-support-and-availability-of-zulu-for-azure/).
