# Java long-term support and medium-term support on Azure and Azure Stack

Java developers on Azure and Azure Stack can build and run production Java applications by using the [Azul Zulu for Azure - Enterprise Edition](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) JDK builds without incurring additional support costs. You can use any Java runtime you want on Azure. But when you use Zulu, you get free maintenance updates and can create support tickets with Microsoft.

Releases designated as long-term support (LTS) are the same LTS releases designated by Oracle and the OpenJDK community. For LTS releases, we provide at least 8 years of access to bug fixes, security updates, and other (Production Support) fixes as needed. We also provide 2 years of additional support intended to advise and assist users who are migrating to a newer JDK version (Extended Support).

For those releases designated as medium-term support (MTS), we provide Production Support for at least 1.5 years after the general availability of the next LTS release. We also provide an additional 1 year of Extended Support.

## What is the Zulu OpenJDK for Azure?

Azul Zulu for Azure - Enterprise Edition builds of OpenJDK are free, multiplatform, production-ready distributions of the OpenJDK for Azure and Azure Stack. They're backed by Microsoft and Azul Systems. These distributions are:

* 100% open-source builds of OpenJDK packaged as Java Development Kits (JDKs), Java Runtime Environments (JREs), and headless JREs. These binaries are fully compatible and compliant commercial builds of Java Standard Edition (SE) that can be used with Java applications or components on Azure and Azure Stack.
* Provided with long-term support, including bug fixes, performance enhancements, and security patches.
* Available for developing and running Java applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
* Available as container images on Docker Hub and as virtual machines (Windows and Linux) on Azure Marketplace.
* Used by Microsoft Azure to power many Azure services, such as:
  * App Service on Windows
  * App Service on Linux
  * Azure Functions
  * Azure Service Fabric
  * Azure HDInsight
  * Azure Cognitive Search
  * Azure DevOps
  * Azure Cloud Shell  

## Supported Java versions and update schedule

Azul Systems provides fully supported [Azul Zulu for Azure - Enterprise Edition](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) builds for all long-term support (LTS) and medium-term support (MTS) versions of Java, including Java SE 7, 8, 11, 13, and 15. For more information, see the [Azul press release](https://www.azul.com/press_release/free-java-production-support-for-microsoft-azure-azure-stack) and the [Azul Product Support Lifecycle](https://www.azul.com/products/azul_support_roadmap/) roadmap.

|Java SE version  |Supported until  |
|---------|----------|
|[![Java 7 logo](media/supported-java-versions-java-7.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/?version=java-7-lts) |July 2023 (LTS)|
|[![Java 8 logo](media/supported-java-versions-java-8.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/?version=java-8-lts) |December 2030 (LTS)|
|[![Java 11 logo](media/supported-java-versions-java-11.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/?version=java-11-lts) |September 2027 (LTS)|
|[![Java 13 logo](media/supported-java-versions-java-13.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/?version=java-13) |March 2023 (MTS)|
|[![Java 15 logo](media/supported-java-versions-java-15.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/?version=java-15) |March 2023 (MTS)|

LTS and MTS JDK releases have quarterly security updates, bug fixes, and critical out-of-band updates and patches as needed. This support includes backports to Java 7 and 8 of security updates and bug fixes reported in newer versions of Java, like Java 11. This backporting ensures the continued stability and security of older versions of Java. Azure customers can get these security updates and platform bug fixes without incurring any unplanned Java SE subscription fees.

Currently, Azure Functions requires Java 8, and support for Java 11 is still in development.

## Benefits for developers

## Use for local development

Developers can [download Java JDKs for Azure and Azure Stack](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) for use in local development environments. Downloads are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Developers working on Linux can also get packages through the [yum](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#yum-repo) and [apt](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#apt-repo) package managers.

For more information, see [Docker images for Azure](java-jdk-docker-images.md).
