# Deploy applications to Azure hosting services

The following list provides references on how to deploy applications to various Azure hosting services.

For more information, see the [Connect to VM](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-vm#connect-to-vm) section of [Tutorial: Create and Manage Linux VMs with the Azure CLI](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-manage-vm). After you connect to the VM, you have to install and configure your applications yourself.
