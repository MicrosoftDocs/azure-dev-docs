# Use Azure Event Grid in Spring

This article shows you how to use Azure Event Grid to send an event to a topic and use Service Bus Queue as an [Event Handler](/azure/event-grid/event-handlers) to receive in a Spring Boot application.

The [Azure Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/) service is a highly scalable, fully managed Pub Sub message distribution service that offers flexible message consumption patterns using the MQTT and HTTP protocols.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/) version 8 or higher.

- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), version 3.0 or higher.

- An Event Grid Topic instance. If you don't have one, see [Create a custom topic or a domain in Azure Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/create-custom-topic).

- A Service Bus Queue instance. If you don't have one, see [Create a queue in the Azure portal](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-portal).

- A Spring Boot application. If you don't have one, create a Maven project with the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). Be sure to select **Maven Project** and select Java version 8 or higher.

## Subscribe to custom topic

Use the following steps to create an event subscription to tell the Event Grid to send events to the Service Bus Queue:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Event Grid Topic instance.
1. Select **Event Subscriptions** on the toolbar.
1. On the **Create Event Subscription page**, enter a **name** value for the event subscription.
1. For **Endpoint Type**, select **Service Bus Queue**.
1. Choose **Select an endpoint** and then select the Service Bus Queue instance you created earlier.

## Send an event by Azure Event Grid and receive by Azure Service Bus Queue

With an Azure Event Grid resource, you can send an event using Spring Cloud Azure Event Grid. With an Azure Service Bus Queue resource as an event handler, you can receive the event using Spring Cloud Azure Stream Binder for Service Bus.

To install the Spring Cloud Azure Event Grid Starter module and the Spring Cloud Azure Stream Binder Service Bus module, add the following dependencies to your *pom.xml* file:

- The Spring Cloud Azure Bill of Materials (BOM):

  ```xml
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</artifactId>
        <version>5.15.0</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using Spring Boot 2.x, be sure to set the `spring-cloud-azure-dependencies` version to `4.19.0`.
  > This Bill of Material (BOM) should be configured in the `<dependencyManagement>` section of your *pom.xml* file. This ensures that all Spring Cloud Azure dependencies are using the same version.
  > For more information about the version used for this BOM, see [Which Version of Spring Cloud Azure Should I Use](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Spring-Versions-Mapping#which-version-of-spring-cloud-azure-should-i-use).

- The Spring Cloud Azure Event Grid Starter artifact:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-eventgrid</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ```

- The Spring Cloud Azure Stream Binder Service Bus artifact:

  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder-servicebus</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ```

## Code the application

Use the following steps to configure your application to send an event by using Event Grid and receive by using Service Bus Queue.

1. Configure Azure Event Grid and Service Bus credentials in the *application.yaml* configuration file, as shown in the following example:

   ```properties
   spring:
     cloud:
       azure:
         eventgrid:
           endpoint: ${AZURE_EVENTGRID_ENDPOINT}
           key: ${AZURE_EVENTGRID_KEY}
         servicebus:
           connection-string: ${AZURE_SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING}
       function:
         definition: consume
       stream:
         bindings:
           consume-in-0:
             destination: ${AZURE_SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME}
         servicebus:
           bindings:
             consume-in-0:
               consumer:
                 auto-complete: false
   ```

1. Edit the startup class file to show the following content. This code generates completions.

   ```java
   import com.azure.core.util.BinaryData;
   import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridEvent;
   import com.azure.messaging.eventgrid.EventGridPublisherClient;
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
   import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
   import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
   import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
   import org.springframework.messaging.Message;

   import java.util.List;
   import java.util.function.Consumer;

   @SpringBootApplication
   public class EventGridSampleApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

       private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EventGridSampleApplication.class);

       @Autowired
       EventGridPublisherClient<EventGridEvent> client;

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(EventGridSampleApplication.class, args);
       }

       @Bean
       public Consumer<Message<String>> consume() {
           return message -> {
               List<EventGridEvent> eventData = EventGridEvent.fromString(message.getPayload());
               eventData.forEach(event -> {
                   LOGGER.info("New event received: '{}'", event.getData());
               });
           };
       }

       @Override
       public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
           String str = "FirstName: John, LastName: James";
           EventGridEvent event = new EventGridEvent("A user is created", "User.Created.Text", BinaryData.fromObject(str), "0.1");

           client.sendEvent(event);
           LOGGER.info("New event published: '{}'", event.getData());
       }
   }

   ```

1. Start the application. After launch, the application produces logs similar to the following example:

   ```output
   New event published: '"FirstName: John, LastName: James"'
   ...
   New event received: '"FirstName: John, LastName: James"'
   ```
