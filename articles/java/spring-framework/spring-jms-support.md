# Use Azure Service Bus with JMS

This article describes how to use Azure Service Bus with the JMS API integrated into the Spring JMS framework.

## Core features

### Passwordless connection

Passwordless connection uses Microsoft Entra authentication for connecting to Azure services without storing any credentials in the application, its configuration files, or in environment variables. Microsoft Entra authentication is a mechanism for connecting to Azure Service Bus using identities defined in Microsoft Entra ID. With Microsoft Entra authentication, you can manage Service Bus and other Microsoft services in a central location, which simplifies permission management.

## How it works

Spring Cloud Azure first builds one of the following types of credentials depending on the application authentication configuration:

- `ClientSecretCredential`
- `ClientCertificateCredential`
- `UsernamePasswordCredential`
- `ManagedIdentityCredential`

If none of these types of credentials are found, the credential chain via `DefaultTokenCredential` is used to obtain credentials from application properties, environment variables, managed identity, or IDEs. For more information, see [Spring Cloud Azure authentication](authentication.md).

## Dependency setup

Add the following dependencies if you want to migrate your Spring JMS application to use Azure Service Bus.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-servicebus-jms</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

The following table describes the configurable properties when using the Spring JMS support:

## Basic usage

### Connect to Azure Service Bus JMS using passwordless

Configure the following properties in your **application.yml** file:

```yaml
spring:
  jms:
    servicebus:
      namespace: ${AZURE_SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE}
      pricing-tier: ${PRICING_TIER}
      passwordless-enabled: true
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Service Bus JMS supports using Microsoft Entra ID to authorize requests to Service Bus resources. With Microsoft Entra ID, ensure that you've assigned the **Azure Service Bus Data Owner** role to the Microsoft Entra account you're currently using. For more information, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

### Connect to Azure Service Bus with JMS use Managed Identity

1. To use the managed identity, enable the managed identity for your service and assign the `Azure Service Bus Data Owner` role. For more information, see [Authenticate a managed identity with Microsoft Entra ID to access Azure Service Bus resources](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-managed-service-identity).

1. Configure the following properties in your **application.yml** file:

   ```yaml
   spring:
     cloud:
       azure:
         credential:
           managed-identity-enabled: true
     jms:
       servicebus:
         namespace: ${AZURE_SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE}
         pricing-tier: ${PRICING_TIER}
         passwordless-enabled: true
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you're using user-assigned managed identity, also need to add the property `spring.cloud.azure.credential.client-id` with your user-assigned managed identity client ID.

### Connect to Azure Service Bus JMS using connection string

Add the following properties and you're good to go.

```yaml
spring:
  jms:
    servicebus:
      connection-string: ${AZURE_SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING}
      pricing-tier: ${PRICING_TIER}
```

## Connections

Spring Cloud Azure provides the following three Connection Factory options for connecting to Azure Service Bus JMS:

- `JmsPoolConnectionFactory`: Set `spring.jms.servicebus.pool.enabled=true` or leave both pool and cache settings unset to use the default value. This factory maintains a connection pool with customizable options like `spring.jms.servicebus.pool.max-connections`. Additional pool configuration settings - prefixed with `spring.jms.servicebus.pool.` - are detailed in the [Configuration](#configuration) section. This setup enhances performance by leveraging Azure Service Bus's load-balancing capability, distributing traffic across multiple endpoints.

- `CachingConnectionFactory`: Set `spring.jms.cache.enabled=true` and leave `spring.jms.servicebus.pool.enabled` unset. This factory reuses a single connection for all calls to `JmsTemplate`, reducing the overhead of connection creation, which is ideal for low-traffic scenarios. However, this mode does not leverage Azure Service Bus's load-balancing capability.

- `ServiceBusJmsConnectionFactory`: Set `spring.jms.servicebus.pool.enabled=false` and `spring.jms.cache.enabled=false` to use `ServiceBusJmsConnectionFactory` directly, with no pooling or caching. In this mode, each call to `JmsTemplate` creates a new connection, which can be resource-intensive and less efficient.

For optimal performance and load distribution, we recommend using `JmsPoolConnectionFactory` by setting `spring.jms.servicebus.pool.enabled=true`. Avoid wrapping a `JmsPoolConnectionFactory` with a `CachingConnectionFactory` or `ServiceBusJmsConnectionFactory` because this can negate pooling benefits and might result in holding inactive connections after they're evicted from the pool.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Spring Cloud Azure 5.18.0, the default `ConnectionFactory` has been updated to `JmsPoolConnectionFactory` to better use Service Bus server load balancing. If you prefer to continue using the `CachingConnectionFactory` for caching both `Session` and `MessageProducer`, set `spring.jms.cache.enabled` to `true`.
