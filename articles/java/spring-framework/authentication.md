# Spring Cloud Azure authentication

This article describes all the Spring Cloud Azure authentication methods.

<a name='authentication-and-authorization-with-azure-active-directory'></a>

## Authentication and authorization with Microsoft Entra ID

With Microsoft Entra ID, you can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to grant permissions to a security principal, which may be a user or an application service principal. When a security principal (a user or an application) attempts to access an Azure resource, for example an Event Hubs resource, the request must be authorized. With Microsoft Entra ID, access to a resource is a two-step process:

1. First, the security principal's identity is authenticated, and an OAuth 2.0 token is returned.
1. Next, the token is passed as part of a request to the Azure service to authorize access to the specified resource.

### Credential types

Spring Cloud Azure enables you to configure different credential types for authentication, including `DefaultAzureCredential`, `WorkloadIdentityCredential`, `ManagedIdentityCredential`, `ClientSecretCredential`, `AzureCliCredential`, and so on.

#### DefaultAzureCredential

`DefaultAzureCredential` is appropriate for most scenarios where the application is intended to run in the Azure Cloud, because it combines the following credentials:

- Credentials commonly used to authenticate when deployed.
- Credentials used to authenticate in a development environment.

> [!NOTE]
> `DefaultAzureCredential` is intended to simplify getting started with the Azure SDK by handling common scenarios with reasonable default behaviors. If you want more control or the default settings don't support your scenario, you should use other credential types.

`DefaultAzureCredential` attempts to authenticate via the following mechanisms in order:

:::image type="content" source="media/spring-cloud-azure/default-azure-credential-authentication.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the authentication mechanism for `DefaultAzureCredential`." border="false":::

* Environment - `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to read account information specified via environment variables and use it to authenticate.
* Managed Identity - If the application is deployed to an Azure host with Managed Identity enabled, `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to authenticate with that account.
* Workload Identity - If the application is deployed to a virtual machines (VM), `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to authenticate with that account.
* Shared Token Cache - If you authenticated via Visual Studio, `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to authenticate with that account.
* IntelliJ - If you authenticated via Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ, `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to authenticate with that account.
* Azure CLI - If you authenticated an account via the Azure CLI `az login` command, `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to authenticate with that account.
* Azure PowerShell - If you authenticated via Azure PowerShell, `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to authenticate with that account.
* Azure Developer CLI - If you authenticated via the Azure Developer CLI, `DefaultAzureCredential` tries to authenticate with that account.

> [!TIP]
> Be sure the security principal has sufficient permission to access the Azure resource. For more information, see [Authorize access with Microsoft Entra ID](#authorize-access-with-microsoft-entra-id).

> [!NOTE]
> Since Spring Cloud Azure AutoConfigure 4.1.0, you must register a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` bean named `springCloudAzureCredentialTaskExecutor` to manage all threads created by Azure Identity. The name of each thread managed by this thread pool is prefixed with `az-identity-`. This `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` bean is independent of the `Executor` bean provided by Spring Boot.

#### Managed identities

A common challenge is the management of secrets and credentials used to secure communication between different components making up a solution. Managed identities eliminate the need to manage credentials. Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Applications may use the managed identity to obtain Microsoft Entra tokens. For example, an application may use a managed identity to access resources like Azure Key Vault where you can store credentials in a secure manner or to access storage accounts.

We encourage using managed identity instead of using connection string or key in your application because it's more secure and saves the trouble of managing secrets and credentials. In this case, `DefaultAzureCredential` could better serve the scenario of developing locally using account information stored locally, then deploying the application to Azure Cloud and using managed identity.

##### Managed identity types

There are two types of managed identities:

* *System-assigned* - Some Azure services allow you to enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity, an identity is created in Microsoft Entra that's bound to the lifecycle of that service instance. So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.
* *User-assigned* - You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. With user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.

> [!NOTE]
> When using a user-assigned managed identity, you can specify the client ID via `spring.cloud.azure.credential.client-id` or `spring.cloud.azure.<azure-service>.credential.client-id`. You don't need credential configuration if you use a system-assigned managed identity.

> [!TIP]
> In order to access the Azure resource, be sure the security principal has sufficient permission. For more information, see [Authorize access with Microsoft Entra ID](#authorize-access-with-microsoft-entra-id).

For more information about managed identity, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

#### Other credential types

If you want more control than what's provided by `DefaultAzureCredential`, or the default settings don't support your scenario, you should use other credential types.

<a name='authenticate-with-microsoft-entra-id'></a>

### Authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID

To connect applications to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication, you can set the following configurations with the prefix `spring.cloud.azure.credential` or `spring.cloud.azure.<azure-service>.credential`

The following table lists authentication properties:

| Property                    | Description                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| client-id                   | The client ID to use when performing service principal authentication with Azure.                  |
| client-secret               | The client secret to use when performing service principal authentication with Azure.              |
| client-certificate-path     | Path of a PEM certificate file to use when performing service principal authentication with Azure. |
| client-certificate-password | The password of the certificate file.                                                              |
| username                    | The username to use when performing username/password authentication with Azure.                   |
| password                    | The password to use when performing username/password authentication with Azure.                   |
| managed-identity-enabled    | Whether to enable managed identity.                                                                |
| token-credential-bean-name  | The bean name of type `TokenCredential` to use when performing authentication with Azure.          |

> [!TIP]
> For the list of all Spring Cloud Azure configuration properties, see [Spring Cloud Azure configuration properties](configuration-properties-all.md).

The application looks in several places to find an available credential. Each Azure SDK client builder factory adopts a custom bean of type `TokenCredential` first if the property `token-credential-bean-name` is specified, and falls back to use `DefaultAzureCredential` if no credential properties are configured.

#### Authenticate using a customized TokenCredential bean

The following example shows you how to define a custom `TokenCredential` bean to do the authentication:

```java
@Bean
TokenCredential myTokenCredential() {
    // Your concrete TokenCredential instance
}
```

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    token-credential-bean-name: myTokenCredential
```

#### Authenticate using a system-assigned managed identity

The following example shows you how to authenticate using a system-assigned managed identity:

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    managed-identity-enabled: true
```

#### Authenticate using a user-assigned managed identity

The following example shows you how to authenticate using a user-assigned managed identity:

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    managed-identity-enabled: true
    client-id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
```

#### Authenticate using a service principal with client secret

The following example shows you how to authenticate using a service principal with a client secret:

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    client-id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    client-secret: ${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
  profile:
    tenant-id: <tenant>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The values allowed for `tenant-id` are: `common`, `organizations`, `consumers`, or the tenant ID. For more information about these values, see the [Used the wrong endpoint (personal and organization accounts)](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist#cause-3-used-the-wrong-endpoint-personal-and-organization-accounts) section of [Error AADSTS50020 - User account from identity provider doesn't exist in tenant](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist). For information on converting your single-tenant app, see [Convert single-tenant app to multitenant on Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant).

#### Authenticate using a service principal with client certificate

The following example shows you how to authenticate using a service principal with a client PFX certificate:

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    client-id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    client-certificate-path: ${AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH}
    client-certificate-password: ${AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD}
  profile:
    tenant-id: <tenant>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The values allowed for `tenant-id` are: `common`, `organizations`, `consumers`, or the tenant ID. For more information about these values, see the [Used the wrong endpoint (personal and organization accounts)](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist#cause-3-used-the-wrong-endpoint-personal-and-organization-accounts) section of [Error AADSTS50020 - User account from identity provider doesn't exist in tenant](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist). For information on converting your single-tenant app, see [Convert single-tenant app to multitenant on Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant).

The following example shows you how to authenticate using a service principal with client PEM certificate:

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    client-id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    client-certificate-path: ${AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH}
  profile:
    tenant-id: <tenant>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The values allowed for `tenant-id` are: `common`, `organizations`, `consumers`, or the tenant ID. For more information about these values, see the [Used the wrong endpoint (personal and organization accounts)](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist#cause-3-used-the-wrong-endpoint-personal-and-organization-accounts) section of [Error AADSTS50020 - User account from identity provider doesn't exist in tenant](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist). For information on converting your single-tenant app, see [Convert single-tenant app to multitenant on Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant).

#### Authenticate using a user credential

The following example shows you how to authenticate using a user credential:

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    client-id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    username: ${AZURE_USER_USERNAME}
    password: ${AZURE_USER_PASSWORD}
```

#### Authenticate a service using a different credential from others

The following example shows you how to authenticate with Key Vault using a different service principal. This example configures the application with two credentials: one system-assigned managed identity and one service principal. The Key Vault Secret client uses the service principal, but any other components use managed identity instead.

```yaml
spring.cloud.azure:
  credential:
    managed-identity-enabled: true
  keyvault.secret:
    credential:
      client-id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
      client-secret: ${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
    profile:
      tenant-id: <tenant>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The values allowed for `tenant-id` are: `common`, `organizations`, `consumers`, or the tenant ID. For more information about these values, see the [Used the wrong endpoint (personal and organization accounts)](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist#cause-3-used-the-wrong-endpoint-personal-and-organization-accounts) section of [Error AADSTS50020 - User account from identity provider doesn't exist in tenant](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/error-code-aadsts50020-user-account-identity-provider-does-not-exist).

### Authorize access with Microsoft Entra ID

The authorization step requires that one or more Azure roles be assigned to the security principal. The roles that are assigned to a security principal determine the permissions that the principal has.

> [!TIP]
> For the list of all Azure built-in roles, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

The following table lists the Azure built-in roles for authorizing access to Azure services supported in Spring Cloud Azure:

| Role                                                                                                               | Description                                                                                               |

| [Redis Cache Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#redis-cache-contributor)                 | Manage Redis caches.                                                                                      |

> [!NOTE]
> When using Spring Cloud Azure Resource Manager to get the connection strings for Event Hubs, Service Bus, and Storage Queue, or the properties of Cache for Redis, assign the Azure built-in role `Contributor`. Azure Cache for Redis is special, and you can also assign the `Redis Cache Contributor` role to get the Redis properties.

> [!NOTE]
> A Key Vault access policy determines whether a given security principal, namely a user, application or user group, can perform different operations on Key Vault secrets, keys, and certificates. You can assign access policies using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. For more information, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Cosmos DB exposes two built-in role definitions: `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Reader` and `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor`. However, Azure portal support for role management isn't available yet. For more information about the permission model, role definitions, and role assignment, see [Configure role-based access control with Microsoft Entra ID for your Azure Cosmos DB account](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac).

## Authenticate using SAS tokens

You can also configure services for authentication with Shared Access Signature (SAS). `spring.cloud.azure.<azure-service>.sas-token` is the property to configure. For example, use `spring.cloud.azure.storage.blob.sas-token` to authenticate to Storage Blob service.

## Authenticate using connection strings

Some Azure services support connection string to provide connection information and credentials. To connect to those Azure services using connection string, just configure `spring.cloud.azure.<azure-service>.connection-string`. For example, configure `spring.cloud.azure.eventhubs.connection-string` to connect to the Event Hubs service.
