# Create and configure a managed identity on Azure hosting services

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Version 4.19.0 ✔️ Version 5.15.0

This article shows you how to create and configure a managed identity on Azure hosting services. There are two types of managed identities: system-assigned and user-assigned.

For more information about Azure managed identities, see [Microsoft Entra managed identities for Azure resources](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/).

For more information about Microsoft Entra ID, see [What is Microsoft Entra ID?](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis)
