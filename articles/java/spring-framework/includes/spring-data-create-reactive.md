## Create a reactive Spring Boot application

To create a reactive Spring Boot application, we'll use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). The application that we'll create uses:

- Spring Boot 2.7.11.
- The following dependencies: Spring Reactive Web (also known as Spring WebFlux) and Spring Data R2DBC.
