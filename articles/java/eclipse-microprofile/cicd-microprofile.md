# CI/CD for MicroProfile apps using Azure Pipelines

This tutorial shows you how to easily set up an Azure Pipelines continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) release cycle to deploy your [MicroProfile](http://microprofile.io) Java EE application to an Azure Web App for Containers. The MicroProfile app in this tutorial uses a [Payara Micro](https://www.payara.fish/products/payara-micro/) base image to create a WAR file. 

```Dockerfile
FROM payara/micro:5.182
COPY target/*.war $DEPLOY_DIR/ROOT.war
EXPOSE 8080
```
You start the Azure Pipelines containerization process by building a Docker image and pushing the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR). You complete the process by creating an Azure Pipelines release pipeline and deploying the container image to a web app.

## Prerequisites

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), create an [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry).
   
1. In the Azure portal, create an [Azure Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/). Select **Linux** for the **OS**, and for **Configure container**, select **Quickstart** as the **Image source**.  
   
1. Copy and save the clone URL from the sample GitHub repository at [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microprofile-hello-azure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/microprofile-hello-azure).
   
1. Register or log into your [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) organization, and create a new [project](/vsts/organizations/projects/create-project). 
   
1. Import the sample GitHub repository into Azure Repos:
   
   1. From your Azure DevOps project page, select **Repos** in the left navigation.
   1. Under **or import a repository**, select **Import**. 
   1. Under **Clone URL**, enter the Git clone URL you saved, and select **Import**.
  
## Create a build pipeline

The continuous integration Build pipeline in Azure Pipelines automatically executes all build tasks each time there's a commit in the Java EE source app. In this example, Azure Pipelines uses Maven to build the Java MicroProfile project.

1. From your Azure DevOps project page, select **Pipelines** > **Builds** in the left navigation. 
   
1. Select **New Pipeline**.
   
1. Select **Use the classic editor to create a pipeline without YAML**. 
   
1. Make sure your project name and imported GitHub repository appear in the fields, and select **Continue**.
   
1. Select **Maven** from the list of templates, and then select **Apply**.
   
1. In the right pane, make sure **Hosted Ubuntu 1604** appears in the **Agent pool** dropdown.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > This setting lets Azure Pipelines know which build server to use.  You can also use your private, customized build server.
   
1. To configure the pipeline for continuous integration, select the **Triggers** tab on the left pane, and then select the checkbox next to **Enable continuous integration**.  
   
1. At the top of the page, select the dropdown next to **Save & queue**, and select **Save**.

## Create a Docker build image

Azure Pipelines uses a Dockerfile with a base image from Payara Micro to create a Docker image.  

1. Select the **Tasks** tab, and then select the plus sign **+** next to **Agent job 1** to add a task.
   
   ![Add a new task](media/cicd-microprofile/add-task.png)
   
1. In the right pane, select **Docker** from the list of templates, and then select **Add**. 
   
1. Select **buildAndPush** in the left pane, and in the right pane, enter a description in the **Display name** field.
   
1. Under **Container Repository**, select **New** next to the **Container Registry** field. 
   
1. Fill out the **Add a Docker Registry service connection** dialog as follows:
   
   |Field|Value|
   |---|---|
   |**Registry type**|Select **Azure Container Registry**.|
   |**Connection Name**|Enter a name for the connection.|
   |**Azure subscription**|Select your Azure subscription from the dropdown, and if necessary, select **Authorize**.|
   |**Azure container registry**|Select your Azure Container Registry name from the dropdown.| 
   
1. Select **OK**.
   
   ![Add a Docker Registry service connection](media/cicd-microprofile/dockerconnection.png)
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're using Docker Hub or another registry, select **Docker Hub** or **Others** instead of **Azure Container Registry** next to **Registry type**. Then provide the credentials and connection information for your container registry.
   
1. Under **Commands**, select **build** from the **Command** dropdown.
   
1. Select the ellipsis **...** next to the **Dockerfile** field, browse to and select the **Dockerfile** from your GitHub repository, and then select **OK**. 
   
   ![Select the Dockerfile](media/cicd-microprofile/selectdockerfile.png)
   
1. Under **Tags**, enter *latest* on a new line. 
   
1. At the top of the page, select the dropdown next to **Save & queue**, and select **Save**. 

## Push the Docker image to ACR

Azure Pipelines pushes the Docker image to your Azure Container Registry, and uses it to run the MicroProfile API app as a containerized Java web app.

1. Since you're using Docker in Azure Pipelines, create another Docker template by repeating the steps under [Create a Docker build image](#create-a-docker-build-image). This time, select **push** in the **Command** dropdown.
   
1. Select the dropdown next to **Save & queue**, and select **Save & queue**. 
   
1. In the **Run pipeline** popup, make sure **Hosted Ubuntu 1604** is selected under **Agent pool**, and select **Save and run**. 
   
1. After the build finishes, you can select the hyperlink on the **Build** page to verify build success and see other details.
