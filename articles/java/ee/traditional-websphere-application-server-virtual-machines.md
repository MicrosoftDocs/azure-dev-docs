# Quickstart: Deploy WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cluster on Azure Virtual Machines

In this quickstart, you quickly deploy a cluster of traditional WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Network Deployment (ND) instances on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). This article uses the Azure Marketplace offer for IBM WAS ND cluster to accelerate your journey to Azure VMs. The offer automatically provisions a number of resources including latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VMs with fixes, latest WebSphere Application Server ND 9.0.5.x on each VM with fixes, latest IBM Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 with fixes on each VM, a Deployment Manager on one of the VMs with Administrative Console enabled, and optionally an IBM HTTP Server (IHS) or Azure Application Gateway as load balancer. Visit Azure portal to see the offer [IBM WAS ND cluster on Azure VMs](https://aka.ms/twas-cluster-portal). 

If you prefer manual step-by-step guidance for installing IBM WAS ND cluster that doesn't utilize the automation enabled by the offer, see [Tutorial: Manually install IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment traditional on Azure Virtual Machines](../migration/migrate-websphere-to-azure-vm-manually.md?toc=/azure/developer/java/ee/toc.json&bc=/azure/developer/java/breadcrumb/toc.json).

If you're interested in providing feedback or working closely on your migration scenario with the engineering team developing WebSphere on Azure solutions, fill out this short [survey on WebSphere migration](https://aka.ms/websphere-on-azure-survey) and include your contact information. The team of program managers, architects, and engineers will promptly get in touch with you to initiate close collaboration.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
- Ensure the Azure identity you use to sign in has either the [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role or the [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) role in the current subscription. For an overview of Azure roles, see [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)
- An IBMid with necessary entitlement for WebSphere Traditional (optional). If you create the deployment with an evaluation license, you don't need to provide an IBMid with entitlement for WebSphere Traditional. To get the benefit, you need to accept the [IBM WebSphere Application Server License Agreement](https://ibm.biz/tWASNDLicenseAzureVMs) during the deployment creation steps. Otherwise, you must enter your registered IBMid and your IBMid must have active WebSphere entitlements associated with it. If provisioning with IBMid fails due to lack of entitlements, ask the primary or secondary contacts for your IBM Passport Advantage site to grant you access. Alternately, follow steps at IBM eCustomer Care for further assistance. This offer assumes you're properly licensed to run offers in Microsoft Azure. For more information, see [IBM eCustomer Care](https://ibm.biz/IBMidEntitlement).

## Deploy a cluster

The steps in this section direct you to deploy an IBM WAS ND cluster on Azure VMs.

Use the following steps to find the IBM WAS ND cluster on Azure VMs offer:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
1. In the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, enter **IBM WAS ND**. In the search results, in the **Marketplace** section, select **IBM WAS ND cluster on Azure VMs**.

## Trying out an application

First, use the following steps to enable the option **Synchronize changes with Nodes** so that any configuration can be automatically synchronized to all application servers of the cluster:

1. On the administrative console that you signed into earlier, select **System administration** > **Console Preferences**.
1. In the **Console Preferences** pane, select **Synchronize changes with Nodes**, and then select **Apply**. You should see the message **Your preferences have been changed.**

Now, follow these instructions if you'd like to try out an application in the cluster:

1. On the administrative console that you signed into earlier, select **Applications** > **New Application** and then select **New Enterprise Application**.

2. On the next panel, select **Remote file system** and then select **Browse…**. You're given the option to browse the file systems of your installed servers.

3. Select the system that begins with **Dmgr**. You're shown the Deployment Manager's file system. From there, select **V9** and then **installableApps**. In that directory, you should see many applications available to install. Select **DefaultApplication.ear** and then select **OK**.

Then, you're taken back to the page for selecting the application, which should look like the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/select-test-app-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IBM WebSphere 'Specify the EAR, WAR, JAR, or SAR module to upload and install' dialog.":::

Select **Next** and then **Next** to go with the **Fast Path** deployment process.

In the **Fast Path** wizard, use the defaults for everything except **Step 2: Map modules to servers**. On that page, select the checkbox for the **Default Web Application Module** row, then hold Ctrl and select the options under **Clusters and servers**. Finally, select **Apply**.

:::image type="content" source="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/map-modules-to-servers-configuration-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IBM WebSphere 'Install New Application' dialog with 'Step 2: Map modules to servers' pane." lightbox="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/map-modules-to-servers-configuration-page.png":::

You should see new entries in the table under the **Server** column. These entries should look similar to the ones in the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/map-modules-to-servers-outcome-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IBM WebSphere 'Install New Application' dialog with 'Step 2: Map modules to servers' pane showing and 'Server' table column highlighted." lightbox="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/map-modules-to-servers-outcome-page.png":::

After you complete all the steps, select **Finish**, and then on the next page select **Save**. You should see messages for **Synchronize changes with Nodes**, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/nodes-synchronized-message-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IBM WebSphere 'Install New Application' synchronized to all nodes." lightbox="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/nodes-synchronized-message-page.png":::

Next, you need to start the application. Go to **Applications** > **All Applications**. Select the checkbox for **DefaultApplication.ear**, ensure the **Action** is set to **Start**, and then select **Submit Action**.

You should see success messages, as shown in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/start-app-message-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of IBM WebSphere Messages pane." lightbox="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/start-app-message-page.png":::

When you see the success messages, you can try the app. In your browser, navigate to the IHS deployment and add `/snoop`. You should see information similar to the following about the server instance that processed the request:

:::image type="content" source="media/traditional-websphere-application-server-virtual-machines/test-app-running-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of test application running in a browser.":::

When you refresh the browser, the app cycles through the server instances of the cluster.

## Clean up resources

To avoid Azure charges, you should clean up unnecessary resources. When you no longer need the cluster, use the following steps to delete the resource groups to clean up the resources used in this tutorial:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
1. Enter the resource group name of your WAS ND cluster - for example, `jiangma070924wasndcluster` - in the search box at the top of the Azure portal, and select the matched resource group from the search results.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. In **Enter resource group name to confirm deletion**, enter the resource group name.
1. Select **Delete**.
