# What are solutions to run the WebSphere family of products on Azure?

This article describes the solutions for running the IBM WebSphere family of products on Azure. IBM and Microsoft jointly develop and support these solutions.

The IBM WebSphere product portfolio is a set of industry-leading runtimes powering some of the most mission-critical enterprise applications across geographies and environments. The WebSphere portfolio includes WebSphere (traditional) Application Server, WebSphere Liberty, and Open Liberty.

WebSphere products are key components in enabling enterprise Java workloads on Azure. The jointly developed solutions of the [IBM WebSphere Product Family on Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.2021-02-17_websphere_offerings_contact_me?tab=Overview) are available in Azure Marketplace. They aim to cover a range of use cases from mission-critical existing traditional workloads to cloud-native applications. The solutions target Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), WebSphere Liberty on ARO, Open Liberty on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), WebSphere Liberty on AKS, and WebSphere Application Server on Virtual Machines. The solutions are aimed at making it as easy as possible to migrate your application to the cloud by automating most boilerplate Azure and Java resource provisioning and configuration tasks. After initial provisioning is done, you're completely free to customize deployments further.

If you're interested in providing feedback or working closely on your migration scenarios with the engineering team developing WebSphere on Azure solutions, fill out this short [survey on WebSphere migration](https://aka.ms/websphere-on-azure-survey) and include your contact information. The team of program managers, architects, and engineers will promptly get in touch with you to initiate close collaboration.

You can open support issues on the jointly developed offers with either IBM or Microsoft. When appropriate, IBM and Microsoft collaborate on their resolution. Beyond the offers, Microsoft provides support for Azure. IBM similarly provides support for WebSphere, WebSphere Liberty, and Open Liberty.

## Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)

The offer [WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on ARO](https://ibm.biz/liberty-aro), located in Azure Marketplace, automatically provisions several Azure resources. The offer enables a swift transition to WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO). The automatically provisioned resources include an ARO cluster and the Liberty Operators. A secure OpenShift project is set up to contain your application. The offer can also deploy a sample application or a container image with your application. If you prefer a native OpenShift manual deployment experience instead of automated provisioning using the offer, IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty and ARO. For more information, see [Deploy a Java application with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](liberty-on-aro.md).

## Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on AKS

The offer [WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on AKS](https://ibm.biz/liberty-aks), located in Azure Marketplace, automatically provisions several Azure resources. The offer enables a quick transition to WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on AKS. The automatically provisioned resources include the Azure Container Registry (ACR), an AKS cluster, Azure App Gateway as an Ingress Controller (AGIC), and the Liberty Operators. The offer can also deploy a sample application or a container image with your application. If you prefer a native Kubernetes manual deployment experience instead of automation enabled by the offer, IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty and AKS. For more information, see [Manually deploy a Java application with Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster](howto-deploy-java-liberty-app-manual.md).

## WebSphere Application Server on virtual machines

[WebSphere Cluster on Azure VMs](https://ibm.biz/twas-cluster-portal) and [WebSphere Single Instance on Azure VM](https://ibm.biz/twas-single-portal) are two Azure Marketplace offers that automatically provision several Azure resources, enabling a quick transition to traditional WebSphere Application Server on Azure VMs. The automatically provisioned resources include virtual network, storage, network security group, Java, Linux, WebSphere, and database connectivity (Db2, Oracle database, Azure SQL). Both offers support evaluation and Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) options for WebSphere. With minimal effort, you can provision a fully functional, highly available WebSphere ND cluster, including the Deployment Manager and any number of servers. You can also have the cluster offer provision IBM HTTP Server or Azure App Gateway as a load-balancer. The Deployment Manager and all servers are started by default, which allows you to begin managing the cluster right away using the Admin Console. Similarly, the single instance offer easily provisions a WebSphere (Base) server on a VM with the Console fully functional.

### WebSphere virtual machine base images

IBM and Microsoft also provide the following base VM images for WebSphere ND and Base:

- [IBM WebSphere Application Server VM base image](https://ibm.biz/twas-base-portal)
- [IBM WebSphere Application Server ND VM base image](https://ibm.biz/twas-nd-portal)

The VM images are suitable for customers that need very customized deployments.
