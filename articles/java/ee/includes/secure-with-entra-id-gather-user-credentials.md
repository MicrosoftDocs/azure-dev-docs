In this article, Microsoft Entra ID uses the email address of each user as the user ID for signing in. Use the following steps to get the email address for the admin user and regular user:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Settings** icon (:::image type="icon" source="/entra/identity-platform/media/common/admin-center-settings-icon.png" border="false":::) in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Browse to **Identity > Users > All Users**.
1. Locate the admin user in the list and select it.
1. Locate the **User principal name** field.
1. Use the copy icon next to the value of the field to save the email address of the user to the clipboard. Save the value for later use.
1. To get the email address for the regular user, follow the same steps.

Use the passwords for the admin user and regular user that you set when creating the users.
