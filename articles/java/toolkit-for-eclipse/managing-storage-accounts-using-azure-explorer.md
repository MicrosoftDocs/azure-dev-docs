# Manage storage accounts by using the Azure Explorer for Eclipse

> [!NOTE]
> The Storage Accounts feature in Azure Explorer is deprecated. You can utilize the Azure portal to create and manage storage accounts and containers. See the [Azure Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) documentation for quickstarts on how to manage storage accounts.

Azure Explorer, which is part of the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse, provides Java developers with an easy-to-use solution for managing storage accounts in their Azure account from inside the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE).

## Create a storage account

1. Sign in to your Azure account by using the [Sign-in instructions for the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse](./sign-in-instructions.md).

1. In the **Azure Explorer** view, expand the **Azure** node, right-click **Storage Accounts**, and then click **Create Storage Account**.

1. In the **Create Storage Account** dialog box, specify the following options:

   * **Name**: Specifies the name for the new storage account.

   * **Subscription**: Specifies the Azure subscription that you want to use for the new storage account.

   * **Resource Group**: Specifies the resource group for your storage account. Select one of the following options:
      * **Create New**: Specifies that you want to create a new resource group.
      * **Use Existing**: Specifies that you will select from a list of resource groups that are associated with your Azure account.

   * **Region**: Specifies the location where your storage account will be created (for example, "West US").

   * **Account kind**: Specifies the type of storage account to create (for example, "General purpose v1"). For more information, see [About Azure storage accounts].

   * **Performance**: Specifies which storage account offering to use from the selected publisher (for example, "Standard"). For more information, see [Azure storage scalability and performance targets].

   * **Replication**: Specifies the replication for the storage account (for example, "Locally Redundant"). For more information, see [Azure storage replication].

1. When you have specified all of the preceding options, click **Create**.

## Create and manage storage containers

To create and manage storage containers, visit the Azure portal or programatically provision your resources.

See [Upload, download, and list blobs with the Azure portal](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) for a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the Azure portal to create a container in Azure Storage, and to upload and download block blobs in that container.

## Delete a storage account

1. In the **Azure Explorer** view, right-click the storage account, and then click **Delete**.

1. In the confirmation window, click **OK**.
