# Installing the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse

The Azure Toolkit for Eclipse provides functionality that allows you to easily create, develop, configure, test, and deploy lightweight, highly available, and scalable Java web apps and HDInsight Spark jobs to Azure using the Eclipse development environment.

> [!NOTE]

[!INCLUDE [basic-prerequisites](includes/basic-prerequisites.md)]

There are two methods of installing the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse: by accessing the **Eclipse Marketplace**, and by using the **Install new software** option on the Help menu. Both installation methods will be demonstrated in the following sections.

## Eclipse Marketplace

The Eclipse Marketplace wizard in the Eclipse IDE allows users to browse the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/) and install solutions. The following two options take you to the Eclipse Marketplace:

- Drag the following button to your running Eclipse workspace. This button opens the Eclipse Marketplace with the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse already selected.

   [![Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png)](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=1919278 "Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client")

- On the Eclipse IDE, click the **Help** menu, navigate to **Eclipse Marketplace**, search for "Azure Toolkit for Eclipse", and click **Install**.

1. An Eclipse Marketplace wizard will pop up with installation instructions, including a list of components that will be installed. Verify that all features are selected and click **Confirm >**.

   | Feature | Description |
   |---|---|
   | **Application Insights Plugin for Java** | Allows you to use Azure's telemetry logging and analysis services for your applications and server instances. |
   | **Azure Common Plugin** | Provides the common functionality needed by other toolkit components. |
   | **Azure Container Tools for Eclipse** | Enables you to build and deploy a .WAR as a Docker container to a docker machine. |
   | **Azure Explorer for Eclipse** | Provides an explorer-style interface for managing your Azure resources. |
   | **Azure HDInsight plugin for Java** | Enables Apache Spark application development in Scala. |
   | **Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.1 for SQL Server** | Provides JDBC API for SQL Server and Microsoft Azure SQL Database for Java Platform Enterprise Edition 8. |
   | **Package for Microsoft Azure Libraries for Java** | Provides APIs for accessing Microsoft Azure services, such as storage, service bus, and service runtime. |
   | **WebApp Plugin for Eclipse** | Enables you to deploy your web applications as Azure App Services. |

1. In the **Review Licenses** dialog, review the terms of the license agreements. If you accept the terms of the license agreements, click **I accept the terms of the license agreements**, and then click **Finish**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can check the installation progress on the lower-right corner of your Eclipse workspace.

1. Once installation has completed, you'll be prompted to restart the Eclipse IDE to apply the software update. Click **Restart Now**.

## Install new software

You can install the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse directly from the *Help* menu in the form of new software.

1. Click the **Help** menu, and then click **Install New Software**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/installation/eclipse-install-software-button.png" alt-text="Install new software, Help menu.":::

1. In the **Available Software** dialog, type `https://azuredownloads.blob.core.windows.net/eclipse/` in the **Work with** text box.

1. In the **Name** pane, check **Azure Toolkit for Java**, and uncheck **Contact all update sites during install to find required software**. Your screen should appear similar to the following:

1. If you expand **Azure Toolkit for Java**, you'll see a list of components that will be installed; for example:

   | Feature | Description |
   |---|---|
   | **Application Insights Plugin for Java** | Allows you to use Azure's telemetry logging and analysis services for your applications and server instances. |
   | **Azure Common Plugin** | Provides the common functionality needed by other toolkit components. |
   | **Azure Container Tools for Eclipse** | Enables you to build and deploy a .WAR as a Docker container to a docker machine. |
   | **Azure Explorer for Eclipse** | Provides an explorer-style interface for managing your Azure resources. |
   | **Azure HDInsight plugin for Java** | Enables Apache Spark application development in Scala. |
   | **Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.1 for SQL Server** | Provides JDBC API for SQL Server and Microsoft Azure SQL Database for Java Platform Enterprise Edition 8. |
   | **Package for Microsoft Azure Libraries for Java** | Provides APIs for accessing Microsoft Azure services, such as storage, service bus, and service runtime. |
   | **WebApp Plugin for Eclipse** | Enables you to deploy your web applications as Azure App Services. |

1. Click **Next**. (If you experience unusual delays when installing the toolkit, ensure that **Contact all update sites during install to find required software** is unchecked.)

1. In the **Install Details** dialog, click **Next**.

1. In the **Review Licenses** dialog, review the terms of the license agreements. If you accept the terms of the license agreements, click **I accept the terms of the license agreements** and then click **Finish**. (The remaining steps assume you do accept the terms of the license agreements. If you don't accept the terms of the license agreements, exit the installation process.)

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can check the installation progress on the lower-right corner of your Eclipse workspace.

1. If prompted to restart Eclipse to complete the installation, click **Restart Now**.
