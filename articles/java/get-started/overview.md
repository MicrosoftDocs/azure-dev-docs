# Code, deploy, and scale Java your way

Today, Java developers are looking at how they can bring their existing Java applications to the cloud - or at how to build new cloud-native applications. In doing so, they want to know they can:

- Continue writing code using the Java tools and frameworks they already know and love.
- Deploy their Java applications using their preferred application servers and open-source software.
- Scale their Java applications easily and confidently, including necessities such as security, supporting data and messaging services, caching, monitoring, and automation.
- Choose Azure services based on application needs, considering use case, business goals, security, and budget for a flexible approach.

Microsoft Azure supports all these needs. As a company, Microsoft is committed to making Java developers as efficient and productive as possible, empowering them to use any tool, framework, and application server on any operating system. In the following articles, we examine how Azure delivers on this commitment, letting Java developers continue working the same way they do today - and continue using the tools and software of their choice - while using the power of managed services in the cloud:

- [Code using the Java tools you know and love](code.md)
- [Deploy Java applications with confidence and ease](deploy.md)
- [Scale with end-to-end security, monitoring, and automation](scale.md)
- [Choose the right Azure services for your Java applications](choose.md)

Moving your Java applications to Azure is simple and intuitive, allowing you to benefit from all the cloud has to offer without having to learn new skills or adopt new tools or frameworks. You can continue using familiar tools like IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, GitHub, Maven, and Gradle, and have more time for coding since you don't have to deploy or manage infrastructure.

You can also continue using the same Java application servers and other open-source software you already know and trust. These tools aren't proprietary Microsoft implementations. Rather, they're the real thing from trusted names in the open-source ecosystem, like Spring Boot, JBoss EAP, OpenShift, WebLogic, WebSphere, Kafka, Grafana, and Redis.

Azure also provides everything you need to scale your applications with confidence and ease, starting with proven reference architectures that are designed for cost control, scalability, high availability, security, and more. You also have access to state-of-the-art security features, built-in auto-scaling, tools for end-to-end monitoring and automation, and supporting services for data, messaging, and caching. With Azure, you have everything needed to code, deploy, and scale your Java applications in the cloud - and can start benefiting from all it has to offer without having to change how you work.
