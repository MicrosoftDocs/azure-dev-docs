# Engage with your application users by sending push notifications

Whether you're building consumer or enterprise applications, you want users to use your application actively. There are often times when you want to share breaking news, game updates, exciting offers, product updates, or any other relevant information with your users. To increase engagement with your users and get them to return to your application, you need a way to communicate with your users in real time.

Push notifications provide a fast and efficient way to communicate with your application users. You can reach out to your users at the right time and notify them of desired information, usually in a pop-up item or dialog box on a mobile device, regardless of what they're doing.

## Value of push notifications

Push notifications provide value to users and businesses.

Businesses can:

- Communicate directly with users by sending messages on supported platforms at the right time.
- Boost user engagement by sending real-time updates and reminders to users, encouraging them to engage with the application on a regular basis.
- Retain users and reengage with inactive users who downloaded the application but don't use it to become active again.
- Increase conversion rates by analyzing user behavior, segmenting users, and leveraging campaigns based on mobile push notifications.
- Promote products and services by sending push messages and timely updates to users.
- Target users by sending personalized push messages.

For application users, push notifications:

- Provide value and information in real time.
- Remind users to use the application.
