# Monitor failures and errors in real time for your mobile application

After your application is in use by thousands of users, it's likely to have bugs. Your users might run into unexpected application failures. From the user perspective, all they want is a working and reliable application. Applications that are buggy and fail don't provide a good user experience. Disappointed users will uninstall the app, leave a bad review, or publicly criticize and complain about their experience.

Understanding real-world failure behavior is essential for mobile applications. Your job as a developer isn't finished as soon as you release to app stores. It's important to continuously monitor and measure performance to ensure app stability and maintain user satisfaction. What you need is a way to monitor your application. You need to understand what happened when something goes wrong so that you can prioritize and fix issues that are critical for your business needs.

## Importance of failure monitoring

As a developer, you need to:

- Know details about the health of your application and how it's performing for users.
- Find the root cause and reasons why and where the failure occurred on a user's device.
- Be proactive to triage issues and resolve failures to make your application stable.
- Build better applications and iterate faster to provide a great user experience so that users continue to use your application.
