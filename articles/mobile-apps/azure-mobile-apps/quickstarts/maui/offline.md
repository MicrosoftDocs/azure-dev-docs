# Add offline data sync to your .NET MAUI app

This tutorial covers the offline sync feature of Azure Mobile Apps for .NET MAUI. Offline sync allows end users to interact with a mobile app even when there's no network connection. Changes are stored in a local database. Once the device is back online, these changes are synced with the remote backend.

Prior to starting this tutorial, you should have completed the [.NET MAUI Quickstart Tutorial](./index.md), which includes creating a suitable backend service.

To learn more about the offline sync feature, see the topic [Offline Data Sync in Azure Mobile Apps](../../howto/data-sync.md).

## Update the app to support offline sync

In online operation, you read to and write from a `IRemoteTable<T>`.  When using offline sync, you read to and write from a `IOfflineTable<T>` instead.  The `IOfflineTable` is backed by an on-device SQLite database, and synchronized with the backend database.

### Set the offline database location

In the `TodoApp.MAUI` project, edit the `MainPage.xaml.cs` file.  Change the definition of the `RemoteTodoService` as follows:

``` csharp
TodoService = new RemoteTodoService(GetAuthenticationToken)
{
    OfflineDb = FileSystem.CacheDirectory + "/offline.db"
};
```

If you haven't completed the [authentication tutorial](./authentication.md), the definition should look like this instead:

``` csharp
TodoService = new RemoteTodoService()
{
    OfflineDb = FileSystem.CacheDirectory + "/offline.db"
};
```
