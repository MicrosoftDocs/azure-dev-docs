# Analyze and understand mobile application use

How well do you understand how your users use your applications? How many active users does your application have, and how is usage changing over time? What features are they using, and which ones are used the most? Where are these users based? How many users are using the latest version of the application? All these questions are important to understand to turn your app into a successful business. To answer those kinds of usage analytics questions, you need to collect usage data from your apps.

The more you look down into the data, the more you might find ways to improve your application and keep your users happy. It's important to use data to find actionable insights and keep users satisfied.

## Importance of analytics

- Understand your users, how they interact with your application, and what brings them back to fine-tune your application and provide great experiences to grow your business.
- Track your usage metrics to make informed decisions on how to market your application and better serve your customers.
- Measure your application performance.
- Learn which parts of your application drive value and performance.
- Gain data-driven insights into issues that concern churn and retention.

Use the following services to enable mobile application analytics.
