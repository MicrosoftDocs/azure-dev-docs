# Perform automated testing on thousands of mobile devices simultaneously

Testing can be challenging and increasingly complex because of device fragmentation, application complexity, fast release cycles, short sessions, and high user expectations. You need to regularly make sure that you deliver thoroughly tested applications that provide a great customer experience. Testing isn't an easy task, and it's not a good use of developer time to manually test each release.

Testing challenges can be tackled efficiently. You can test mobile applications across a wide range of devices by using automated testing. You can use cloud services to speed up the release of mobile apps and overcome testing challenges that add bottlenecks to the development and deployment of applications.

## Importance of automated testing

- Increase your test coverage by targeting different form factors, connectivity types, and OS versions.
- Save time, money, and resources by testing on different devices and OS coverage.
- Improve accuracy by avoiding repetitive manual tests and have more time to create new automated software tests and deal with complex features.
- Test continuously, analyze application performance, and find and fix issues before your users run into them and release fast.
- Deliver high-quality applications by ensuring that your customers on a wide range of devices get the best experience.

## Visual Studio App Center

[App Center Test](/appcenter/test-cloud/) is a cloud-based service that you can use to run automated UI tests on thousands of real-world devices in the cloud across Android and iOS for native and hybrid mobile apps.
