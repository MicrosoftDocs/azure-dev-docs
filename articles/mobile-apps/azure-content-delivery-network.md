# Content delivery network on Azure with Azure Content Delivery Network

[Azure Content Delivery Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn/) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content like videos, images, or static files to users by caching their content to hundreds of points of presence across the world. Content Delivery Network can also accelerate dynamic content, which can't be cached, to reduce load times, save bandwidth, and increase responsiveness. You gain these advantages whether you develop or manage websites or mobile applications or encode and distribute streaming media, gaming software, firmware updates, or IoT endpoints.

## Azure Content Delivery Network features

- Work seamlessly with Azure services like web applications, media services, storage, and cloud services.
- Easily handle traffic spikes and heavy loads.
- Integrate with Akamai and Verizon to build and tailor content delivery strategy.
- Use dynamic site acceleration.
- Control Content Delivery Network caching behavior with caching rules.
- Gain HTTPS custom domain support.
- View Azure diagnostics logs to see core analytics and export them to Azure Blob storage, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Monitor.
- Improve performance by compressing files.
- Use geofiltering to restrict Content Delivery Network content by country or region.
