# Deploy an Azure Application Gateway v2 using Terraform to direct web traffic

Article tested with the following Terraform and Terraform provider versions:

- [Terraform v1.1.7](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/)
- [AzureRM Provider v.2.99.0](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)

[!INCLUDE [Terraform abstract](./includes/abstract.md)]

In this article, you deploy an Azure Application Gateway v2 and two Windows Server 2019 Datacenter test servers for the backend pool using Terraform.

> * Deploy an Application Gateway v2 using Terraform
> * Deploy two virtual machines in the Application Gateway backend pool to test
> * Test the Application Gateway to verify the deployment

> [!NOTE]
> The example code in this article is located in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-application-gateway).

## 1. Configure your environment

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]

[!INCLUDE [configure-terraform.md](includes/configure-terraform.md)]

## 2. Implement the Terraform code

1. Create a directory in which to test the sample Terraform code and make it the current directory.

1. Create a file named `providers.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](../../terraform_samples/quickstart/101-application-gateway/providers.tf)]

1. Create a file named `main.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](../../terraform_samples/quickstart/101-application-gateway/main.tf)]

1. Create a file named `variables.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](../../terraform_samples/quickstart/101-application-gateway/variables.tf)]

## 3. Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](includes/terraform-init.md)]

## 4. Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan.md](includes/terraform-plan.md)]

## 5. Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## 6. Verify the results

1. Browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Under **Azure services**, select **Resource groups**.
1. Select the **myResourceGroupAG** resource group.
1. Select the **myAppGateway** resource.
1. On the **Overview** page, copy the **Frontend public IP address** to the clipboard.
1. Paste the public IP address into the address bar of your web browser. Refresh the browser to see the name of the virtual machine. A valid response verifies the application gateway is successfully created and can connect with the backend.

## 7. Clean up resources
