# Tutorial: Store Terraform state in Azure Storage

Terraform state is used to reconcile deployed resources with Terraform configurations. State allows Terraform to know what Azure resources to add, update, or delete.

By default, Terraform state is stored ***there appears to be a missing word or phrase here*** which isn't ideal for the following reasons:

- Local state doesn't work well in a team or collaborative environment.
- Terraform state can include sensitive information.
- Storing state locally increases the chance of inadvertent deletion.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Azure storage to store remote Terraform state.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md](../includes/open-source-devops-prereqs-azure-subscription.md)]

## Configure remote state storage account

Before you use Azure Storage as a back end, you must create a storage account.

Run the following commands or configuration to create an Azure storage account and container:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
```azurecli-interactive
#!/bin/bash

RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=tfstate
STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=tfstate$RANDOM
CONTAINER_NAME=tfstate

# Create resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location eastus

# Create storage account
az storage account create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --sku Standard_LRS --encryption-services blob

# Create blob container
az storage container create --name $CONTAINER_NAME --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell-interactive
$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME='tfstate'
$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="tfstate$(Get-Random)"
$CONTAINER_NAME='tfstate'

# Create resource group
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -Location eastus

# Create storage account
$storageAccount = New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -Name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME -SkuName Standard_LRS -Location eastus -AllowBlobPublicAccess $true

# Create blob container
New-AzStorageContainer -Name $CONTAINER_NAME -Context $storageAccount.context -Permission blob
```

# [Terraform](#tab/terraform)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=2.46.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "random_string" "resource_code" {
  length  = 5
  special = false
  upper   = false
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "tfstate" {
  name     = "tfstate"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "tfstate" {
  name                     = "tfstate${random_string.resource_code.result}"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.tfstate.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.tfstate.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
  allow_blob_public_access = true

  tags = {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "tfstate" {
  name                  = "tfstate"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.tfstate.name
  container_access_type = "blob"
}
```

Save the configuration as `create-remote-stroage.tf`.

Run the command `terraform init`, then `terraform apply` to configure the Azure storage account and container.

**Key points:**
* Public access is allowed to Azure storage account for storing Terraform state.
* Azure storage accounts require a globally unique name. To learn more about troubleshooting storage account names, see [Resolve errors for storage account names](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-storage-account-name).

## Configure terraform backend state

To configure the backend state you need the following Azure storage information:

- **storage_account_name**: The name of the Azure Storage account.
- **container_name**: The name of the blob container.
- **key**: The name of the state store file to be created.
- **access_key**: The storage access key.

Each of these values can be specified in the Terraform configuration file or on the command line. We recommend that you use an environment variable for the `access_key` value. Using an environment variable prevents the key from being written to disk.

Run the following commands to get the storage access key and store it as an environment variable:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
```azurecli-interactive
ACCOUNT_KEY=$(az storage account keys list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --query '[0].value' -o tsv)
export ARM_ACCESS_KEY=$ACCOUNT_KEY
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```azurepowershell
$ACCOUNT_KEY=(Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -Name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME)[0].value
$env:ARM_ACCESS_KEY=$ACCOUNT_KEY
```

# [Terraform](#tab/terraform)
```terraform
```

Terraform prevents sensitive information from being displayed within the terminal. It's recommended to use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to retrieve the access key.

---

**Key points**:
* To further protect the Azure Storage account access key, store it in Azure Key Vault. The environment variable can then be set by using a command similar to the following. For more information on Azure Key Vault, see the [Azure Key Vault documentation](/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-cli).

    ```bash
    export ARM_ACCESS_KEY=$(az keyvault secret show --name terraform-backend-key --vault-name myKeyVault --query value -o tsv)
    ```

Create a Terraform configuration with a `backend` configuration block.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=2.46.0"
    }
  }
    backend "azurerm" {
        resource_group_name  = "tfstate"
        storage_account_name = "<storage_account_name>"
        container_name       = "tstate"
        key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
    }

}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "state-demo-secure" {
  name     = "state-demo"
  location = "eastus"
}
```

Replace `<storage_account_name>` with the name of your Azure storage account.

Run the following command to initialize the configuration:

```bash
terraform init
```

Run the following command to run the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You can now find the state file in the Azure Storage blob.

## State locking

Azure Storage blobs are automatically locked before any operation that writes state. This pattern prevents concurrent state operations, which can cause corruption.

For more information, see [State locking](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/locking.html) in the Terraform documentation.

You can see the lock when you examine the blob through the Azure portal or other Azure management tooling.

## Encryption at rest

Data stored in an Azure blob is encrypted before being persisted. When needed, Terraform retrieves the state from the backend and stores it in local memory. Using this pattern, state is never written to your local disk.

For more information on Azure Storage encryption, see [Azure Storage service encryption for data at rest](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).
