In this quickstart, you deploy a Python web app to [App Service on Linux](/azure/app-service/overview#app-service-on-linux), Azure's highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. You use the local [Azure command-line interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) on a Mac, Linux, or Windows computer to deploy a sample with either the Flask or Django frameworks. The web app you configure uses a free App Service tier, so you incur no costs in the course of this article.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer using Visual Studio Code instead, follow our **[Visual Studio Code App Service quickstart](/azure/developer/python/tutorial-deploy-app-service-on-linux-01)**.
