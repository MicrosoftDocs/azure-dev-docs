# AI app templates

This section of the documentation introduces you to the *AI app templates* and related articles that use these templates to demonstrate how to perform key developer tasks. AI app templates provide you with well-maintained, easy to deploy reference implementations that help to ensure a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

There are two categories of AI app templates, **building blocks** and **end-to-end solutions**. The following sections introduce some of the key templates in each category for the programming language you have selected at the top of this article. To browse a more comprehensive list including these and other templates, see the AI app templates on the [Azure Developer CLI gallery](https://aka.ms/ai-apps).

## Building blocks

Building blocks are smaller-scale samples that focus on specific scenarios and tasks. Most building blocks demonstrate functionality that leverages the [end-to-end solution](#end-to-end-solutions) for a chat app that uses your own data.
