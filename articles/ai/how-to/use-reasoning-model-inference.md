# Develop reasoning apps with DeepSeek models on Azure AI Foundry using the OpenAI SDK

Learn how to use reasoning models like DeepSeek in Azure OpenAI with the OpenAI SDK for Python.

This article shows several best practices for integrating reasoning models:

- **Keyless authentication**: Use managed identities or developer credentials instead of API keys.
- **Asynchronous operations**: Use async features for better performance.
- **Streaming responses**: Provide immediate feedback to users.
- **Reasoning separation**: Separate reasoning steps from the final output.
- **Resource management**: Clean up resources after use.

## The DeepSeek building block

Explore the [DeepSeek building block](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/deepseek-python) sample. It shows how to use the OpenAI client library to call the DeepSeek-R1 model and generate responses to user messages.

## Architectural overview

The following diagram shows the simple architecture of the sample app:
:::image type="content" source="../media/use-reasoning-model-inference/simple-architecture-diagram.png" lightbox="../media/use-reasoning-model-inference/simple-architecture-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing architecture from client to backend app.":::

The chat app runs as an Azure Container App. The app uses managed identity with Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate with Azure OpenAI instead of an API key. The app uses Azure OpenAI to generate responses to user messages.

The app relies on these services and components:

- A Python [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) app that uses the [OpenAI client library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) package to generate responses to user messages
- A basic HTML/JS frontend that streams responses from the backend using [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) over a [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)
- [Bicep files](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/) for provisioning Azure resources, including Azure AI Services, Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Registry, Azure Log Analytics, and RBAC roles.

## Cost

To keep costs low, this sample uses basic or consumption pricing tiers for most resources. Adjust the tier as needed, and delete resources when you're done to avoid charges.

Learn more about [cost in the sample repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/deepseek-python#costs).

## Prerequisites

A [development container](https://containers.dev/) includes all the dependencies you need for this article. You can run it in GitHub Codespaces (in a browser) or locally using Visual Studio Code.

To follow this article, make sure you meet these prerequisites:

#### [GitHub Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

- An Azure subscription – [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services?azure-portal=true)

#### [GitHub Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces) runs a development container managed by GitHub with [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) as the interface. Use GitHub Codespaces for the simplest setup, as it comes with the necessary tools and dependencies preinstalled for this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with two core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

Use the following steps to create a new GitHub Codespace on the `main` branch of the [`Azure-Samples/deepseek-python`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/deepseek-python) GitHub repository.

1. Right-click the following button and select _Open link in new window_. This action lets you have the development environment and the documentation open side by side.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/deepseek-python)

1. On the **Create codespace** page, review and then select **Create new codespace**

1. Wait for the codespace to start. It might take a few minutes.

1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI in the terminal at the bottom of the screen.

1. Copy the code from the terminal and then paste it into a browser. Follow the instructions to authenticate with your Azure account.

You do the rest of the tasks in this development container.

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code needs [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) installed on your computer. The extension uses Docker to host the development container locally with the necessary tools and dependencies preinstalled for this article.

1. Create a new local directory on your computer for the project.

    ```shell
    mkdir my-chat-app
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory you created.

    ```shell
    cd my-chat-app
    ```

1. Open Visual Studio Code in that directory:

    ```shell
    code .
    ```

1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
1. Run the following AZD command to bring the GitHub repository to your local computer.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd init -t deepseek-python
    ```

1. Open the Command Palette, search for and select **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container** to open the project in a dev container. Wait until the dev container opens before continuing.

1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

## Deploy and run

The sample repository has all the code and configuration files you need to deploy the chat app to Azure. Follow these steps to deploy the chat app to Azure.

### Deploy chat app to Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure resources created in this section start costing money immediately. These resources might still incur costs even if you stop the command before it finishes.

1. Run the following Azure Developer CLI command for Azure resource provisioning and source code deployment:

    ```azdeveloper
    azd up
    ```

1. Use the following table to answer the prompts:

    |Prompt|Answer|
    |--|--|
    |Environment name|Keep it short and lowercase. Add your name or alias. For example, `chat-app`. It's used as part of the resource group name.|
    |Subscription|Select the subscription to create the resources in. |
    |Location (for hosting)|Select a location near you from the list.|
    |Location for the DeepSeek model|Select a location near you from the list. If the same location is available as your first location, select that.|

1. Wait for the app to deploy. Deployment usually takes 5 to 10 minutes.

### Use chat app to ask questions to the large language model

1. After deployment, the terminal shows a URL.

1. Select the URL labeled `Deploying service web` to open the chat app in your browser.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/use-reasoning-model-inference/screenshot-chat-image.png" lightbox="../media/use-reasoning-model-inference/screenshot-chat-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat app in browser with a question in the chat text box along with the response.":::

1. In the browser, ask a question about the uploaded image such as "Who painted the Mona Lisa?"

1. Azure OpenAI provides the answer through model inference, and the result appears in the app.

## Exploring the sample code

OpenAI and Azure OpenAI Service both use the [common Python client library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), but you need to make a few small code changes for Azure OpenAI endpoints. This sample uses a DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model to generate responses in a simple chat app.

### Setup and authentication

The `src\quartapp\chat.py` file starts with setup and configuring keyless authentication.

#### Infrastructure setup

The script uses **Quart**, an async web framework, to create a `Blueprint` named `chat`. This `Blueprint` defines the app's routes and manages its lifecycle hooks.

```python
bp = Blueprint("chat", __name__, template_folder="templates", static_folder="static")
```

The `Blueprint` defines the `/` and `/chat/stream` routes and the `@bp.before_app_serving` and `@bp.after_app_serving` lifecycle hooks.

#### Initialization with keyless authentication

The following code snippet handles authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> The `@bp.before_app_serving` hook initializes the OpenAI client and handles **authentication**. This approach is critical for securely accessing Azure-hosted DeepSeek-R1 models.

The authentication strategy adapts to the environment:

- **In production**: Uses **Managed Identity Credential** with an Azure client ID to avoid storing sensitive keys. This method is secure and scalable for cloud-native apps.
- **In development**: Uses **Azure Developer CLI Credential** with an Azure tenant ID to simplify local testing by using the developer's Azure CLI sign-in session.

```python
@bp.before_app_serving
async def configure_openai():
    if os.getenv("RUNNING_IN_PRODUCTION"):
        client_id = os.environ["AZURE_CLIENT_ID"]
        bp.azure_credential = ManagedIdentityCredential(client_id=client_id)
    else:
        tenant_id = os.environ["AZURE_TENANT_ID"]
        bp.azure_credential = AzureDeveloperCliCredential(tenant_id=tenant_id)
```

This keyless authentication approach provides:

- **Better security**: No API keys stored in code or environment variables.
- **Easier management**: No need to rotate keys or manage secrets.
- **Smooth transitions**: The same code works in both development and production.

#### Token provider setup

In the following code snippet, the token provider creates a bearer token to authenticate requests to Azure OpenAI services. It automatically generates and refreshes these tokens using the configured credential.

  ```python
  bp.openai_token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
      bp.azure_credential, "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
  )
  ```

#### Azure OpenAI client configuration

There are two possible clients, `AzureOpenAI` and `AsyncAzureOpenAI`. The following code snippet uses `AsyncAzureOpenAI` along with the asynchronous `Quart` framework for better performance with concurrent users:

```python
bp.openai_client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT"],
    azure_ad_token_provider=openai_token_provider,
    api_version="2024-10-21",
```

- **base_url**: Points to the Azure-hosted DeepSeek inference endpoint
- **api_key**: Uses a dynamically generated API key from the token provider.
- **api-version**: Specifies the API version supporting DeepSeek models

#### Model deployment name configuration

The following code snippet sets the DeepSeek model version by getting the deployment name from your environment configuration. It assigns the name to the `bp.model_deployment_name` variable, making it accessible throughout the app. This approach lets you change the model deployment without updating the code.

```python
bp.model_deployment_name = os.getenv("AZURE_DEEPSEEK_DEPLOYMENT")
```

> [!NOTE]
> In Azure OpenAI, you don't directly use model names like `gpt-4o` or `deepseek-r1`. Instead, you create **deployments**, which are named instances of models in your Azure OpenAI resource. This approach offers the following benefits:
> - **Abstraction**: Keeps deployment names out of the code by using environment variables.
> - **Flexibility**: Lets you switch between different DeepSeek deployments without changing the code.
> - **Environment-specific configuration**: Allows using different deployments for development, testing, and production.
> - **Resource management**: Each Azure deployment has its own quota, throttling, and monitoring.

### Lifecycle management

The following code snippet prevents resource leaks by closing the asynchronous Azure OpenAI client when the application shuts down. The `@bp.after_app_serving` hook ensures proper cleanup of resources.

```python
@bp.after_app_serving
async def shutdown_openai():
    await bp.openai_client.close()
```

### Chat handler streaming function

The `chat_handler()` function manages user interactions with the `DeepSeek-R1` model through the `chat/stream` route. It streams responses back to the client in real time and processes them. The function extracts messages from the JSON payload.

#### Streaming implementation

1. The `response_stream` function starts by accepting messages from the client.

   - request_messages: The route expects a JSON payload containing user messages.

   ```python
   @bp.post("/chat/stream")
   async def chat_handler():
      request_messages = (await request.get_json())["messages"]
   ```

1. Next, the function streams responses from the OpenAI API. It combines system messages like "You're a helpful assistant" with user-provided messages.

      ```python
      @stream_with_context
      async def response_stream():
          all_messages = [
              {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          ] + request_messages
      ```

1. Next, the function creates a streaming chat completion request.

    The `chat.completions.create` method sends the messages to the `DeepSeek-R1` model. The `stream=True` parameter enables real-time response streaming.

    ```python
      chat_coroutine = bp.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
          model=bp.openai_model,
          messages=all_messages,
          stream=True,
      )
    ```

1. The following code snippet processes streaming responses from the `DeepSeek-R1` model and handles errors. It iterates through updates, checks for valid choices, and sends each response chunk as JSON Lines. If an error occurs, it logs the error and sends a JSON error message to the client while continuing the stream.

    ```python
    try:
        async for update in await chat_coroutine:
            if update.choices:
                yield update.choices[0].model_dump_json() + "\n"
        except Exception as e:
            current_app.logger.error(e)
            yield json.dumps({"error": str(e)}, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n"
    
    return Response(response_stream())
    ```

### Reasoning content handling

While traditional language models only provide final outputs, reasoning models like `DeepSeek-R1` show their intermediate reasoning steps. These steps make them useful for:

- Solving complex problems
- Performing mathematical calculations
- Handling multi-step logical reasoning
- Making transparent decisions

The `submit` event handler in `index.html` processes the streaming response on the frontend. This approach lets you access and display the model's reasoning steps alongside the final output.

The frontend uses a `ReadableStream` to process streaming responses from the backend. It separates reasoning content from regular content, showing reasoning in an expandable section, and the final answer in the main chat area.

#### Step-by-step breakdown

1. Initiate streaming request

   This code snippet creates a connection between the JavaScript frontend and the Python backend, enabling DeepSeek-R1's Azure OpenAI integration with keyless authentication.

    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch("/chat/stream", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        body: JSON.stringify({messages: messages})
    });
    ```

1. Initialize variables

   The following code snippet initializes variables to store the answer and thoughts separately. This separation helps handle reasoning content effectively.

   ```javascript
   let answer = "";
   let thoughts = "";    
   ```

1. Process each update

   The following code snippet asynchronously iterates through chunks of the model's response.

   ```javascript
   for await (const event of readNDJSONStream(response.body)) {
   ```

1. Detect and route content type

   The script checks if the event contains a `delta` field. If it does, it processes the content based on whether it's reasoning content or regular content.

   ```javascript
   if (!event.delta) {
        continue;
   }
   if (event.delta.reasoning_content) {
        thoughts += event.delta.reasoning_content;
        if (thoughts.trim().length > 0) {
            // Only show thoughts if they are more than just whitespace
            messageDiv.querySelector(".loading-bar").style.display = "none";
            messageDiv.querySelector(".thoughts").style.display = "block";
            messageDiv.querySelector(".thoughts-content").innerHTML = converter.makeHtml(thoughts);
        }
    } else if (event.delta.content) {
        messageDiv.querySelector(".loading-bar").style.display = "none";
        answer += event.delta.content;
        messageDiv.querySelector(".answer-content").innerHTML = converter.makeHtml(answer);
    }
   ```

   - If the content type is `reasoning_content`, the content is added to `thoughts` and displayed in the `.thoughts-content` section.
   - If the content type is `content`, the content is added to `answer` and displayed in the `.answer-content` section.
   - The `.loading-bar` is hidden once content starts streaming, and the `.thoughts` section is displayed if there are any thoughts.
  
1. Error handling:

   Errors are logged in the backend and returned to the client in JSON format.

    ```python
    except Exception as e:
        current_app.logger.error(e)
        yield json.dumps({"error": str(e)}, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n"
    ```
  
    This frontend code snippet displays the error message in the chat interface.

    ```javascript
    messageDiv.scrollIntoView();
    if (event.error) {
        messageDiv.innerHTML = "Error: " + event.error;
    }
    ```
