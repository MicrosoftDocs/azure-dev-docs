# Build a TypeScript MCP server using Azure Container Apps

This article explains how to build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using Node.js and TypeScript. The server runs tools and services in a serverless environment. Use this structure as a starting point to create custom MCP servers.

## Get to the code

Explore the [TypeScript remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-container-ts) sample. It demonstrates how to use Node.js and TypeScript to build a remote MCP server and deploy it to Azure Container Apps.

## Architectural overview

The following diagram shows the simple architecture of the sample app:
:::image type="content" source="./media/build-mcp-server-ts/simple-architecture-diagram.png" lightbox="./media/build-mcp-server-ts/simple-architecture-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing architecture from Visual Studio Code hosting the agent and MCP client to MCP Server.":::

The MCP server runs as a containerized app on Azure Container Apps (ACA). It uses a Node.js/TypeScript backend to provide tools to the MCP client through the Model Context Protocol. All tools work with a backend SQLite database.

## Cost

To keep costs low, this sample uses basic or consumption pricing tiers for most resources. Adjust the tier as needed, and delete resources when you're done to avoid charges.

## Prerequisites

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Latest version to support MCP Server development.
1. [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) Visual Studio Code extension

## Open development environment

Follow these steps to set up a preconfigured development environment with all the required dependencies.

#### [GitHub Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces) runs a development container managed by GitHub with [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) as the interface. Use GitHub Codespaces for the simplest setup, as it comes with the necessary tools and dependencies preinstalled for this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with two core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

Use the following steps to create a new GitHub Codespace on the `main` branch of the [`Azure-Samples/mcp-container-ts`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-container-ts) GitHub repository.

1. Right-click the following button and select _Open link in new window_. This action lets you have the development environment and the documentation open side by side.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/mcp-container-ts)

1. On the **Create codespace** page, review and then select **Create new codespace**.

    ```

1. Copy the code from the terminal and then paste it into a browser. Follow the instructions to authenticate with your Azure account.

You do the rest of the tasks in this development container.

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code needs [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) installed on your computer. The extension uses Docker to host the development container locally with the necessary tools and dependencies preinstalled for this article.

1. Create a new local directory on your computer for the project.

    ```shell
    mkdir my-mcp-server
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory you created.

    ```shell
    cd my-mcp-server
    ```

1. Open Visual Studio Code in that directory:

    ```shell
    code .
    ```

1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
1. Run the following AZD command to bring the GitHub repository to your local computer.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd init -t mcp-container-ts
    ```

1. Open the Command Palette, search for and select **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container** to open the project in a dev container. Wait until the dev container opens before continuing.

1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd auth login
    ```

1. You do the rest of the exercises in this development container.

> [!NOTE]
> To run the MCP server locally:
>    1. Set up your environment as described in the [Local environment setup](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-container-ts?tab=readme-ov-file#local-environment) section in the sample repository.
>    1. Configure your MCP Server to use the local environment by following the instructions in the [Configure the MCP server in Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-container-ts?tab=readme-ov-file#test-your-mcp-server-with-desktop-mcp-clients) section in the sample repository.
>    1. Skip to the [Use TODO MCP server tools in agent mode](#use-todo-mcp-server-tools-in-agent-mode) section to continue.

## Deploy and run

The sample repository contains all the code and configuration files for the MCP server Azure deployment. The following steps walk you through the sample MCP server Azure deployment process.

### Deploy to Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure resources in this section start costing money immediately, even if you stop the command before it finishes.

1. Run the following Azure Developer CLI command for Azure resource provisioning and source code deployment:

    ```azdeveloper
    azd up
    ```

1. Use the following table to answer the prompts:

    |Prompt|Answer|
    |--|--|
    |Environment name|Keep it short and lowercase. Add your name or alias. For example, `my-mcp-server`. It's used as part of the resource group name.|
    |Subscription|Select the subscription to create the resources in. |
    |Location (for hosting)|Select a location near you from the list.|
    |Location for the Azure OpenAI model|Select a location near you from the list. If the same location is available as your first location, select that.|

1. Wait until the app is deployed. Deployment usually takes between 5 and 10 minutes to complete.

1. Once the deployment is complete, you can access the MCP server using the URL provided in the output. The URL looks like this:

```bash
https://<env-name>.<container-id>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io
```

1. Copy the URL to your clipboard. You'll need it in the next section.

### Configure the MCP server in Visual Studio Code

Configure the MCP server in your local VS Code environment by adding the URL to the `mcp.json` file in the `.vscode` folder.

1. Open the `mcp.json` file in the `.vscode` folder.

1. Locate the `mcp-server-sse-remote` section in the file. It should look like this:

    ```json
        "mcp-server-sse-remote": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://<container-id>.<location>.azurecontainerapps.io/sse"
    }
    ```

1. Replace the existing `url` value with the URL you copied in the previous step.

1. Save the `mcp.json` file in the `.vscode` folder.

### Use TODO MCP server tools in agent mode

After modifying the MCP server, you can use the tools, it provides in agent mode. To use MCP tools in agent mode:

1. Open the Chat view (`Ctrl+Alt+I`), and select Agent mode from the dropdown.

1. Select the **Tools** button to view the list of available tools.
      Optionally, select or deselect the tools you want to use. You can search tools by typing in the search box.

1. Enter a prompt such as "I need to send an email to my manager on Wednesday" in the chat input box and notice how tools are automatically invoked as needed, as in the following screenshot:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/build-mcp-server-ts/mcp-server-tools-invocation.png" lightbox="./media/build-mcp-server-ts/mcp-server-tools-invocation.png"alt-text="Screenshot showing the MCP server tools invocation.":::

> [!NOTE]
> By default, when a tool is invoked, you need to confirm the action before the tool runs. Otherwise, tools might run locally on your machine and might perform actions that modify files or data.

Use the Continue button dropdown options to automatically confirm the specific tool for the current session, workspace, or all future invocations.

## Exploring the sample code

This section provides an overview of the key files and code structure in the MCP server sample. The code is organized into several main components:

- **`index.ts`**: The main entry point for the MCP server, which sets up the Express.js HTTP server and routing.
- **`server.ts`**: The transport layer that manages Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections and MCP protocol handling.
- **`tools.ts`**: Contains business logic and utility functions for the MCP server.
- **`types.ts`**: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the MCP server.

### `index.ts` - How the server starts and accepts HTTP connections

The `index.ts` file is the main entry point for the MCP server. It initializes the server, sets up the Express.js HTTP server, and defines routing for Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoints.

#### Create the MCP server instance

The following code snippet initializes the MCP server using the `SSEPServer` class, which is a wrapper around the core MCP `Server` class. This class handles the transport layer for Server-Sent Events (SSE) and manages client connections.

```typescript
const server = new SSEPServer(
  new Server(
    {
      name: 'todo-sse-server',
      version: '1.0.0',
    },
    {
      capabilities: {
        tools: {},
      },
    }
  )
);
```

**Concepts**:

- **Composition pattern**: `SSEPServer` wraps the low-level `Server` class
- **Capabilities declaration**: Server announces it supports tools (but not resources/prompts)
- **Naming convention**: Server name becomes part of MCP identification

#### Set up Express routes

The following code snippet sets up the Express.js server to handle incoming HTTP requests for SSE connections and message handling:

```typescript
router.post('/messages', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  await server.handlePostRequest(req, res);
});

router.get('/sse', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  await server.handleGetRequest(req, res);
});
```

**Concepts**:

- **Two-endpoint pattern**: GET for establishing SSE connection, POST for sending messages
- **Delegation pattern**: Express routes immediately delegate to `SSEPServer`

#### Process lifecycle management

The following code snippet handles the server's lifecycle, including starting the server and gracefully shutting it down on termination signals:

```typescript
process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
  log.error('Shutting down server...');
  await server.close();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

**Concepts**:

- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup on Ctrl+C
- **Async cleanup**: Server close operation is asynchronous
- **Resource management**: Important for SSE connections

### Transport layer: `server.ts`

The `server.ts` file implements the transport layer for the MCP server, specifically handling Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections and routing MCP protocol messages.

#### Set up an SSE client connection and create a transport

The `SSEPServer` class is the main transport layer for handling Server-Sent Events (SSE) in the MCP server. It uses the `SSEServerTransport` class to manage individual client connections. It manages multiple transports and their lifecycle.

```typescript
export class SSEPServer {
  server: Server;
  transport: SSEServerTransport | null = null;
  transports: Record<string, SSEServerTransport> = {};

  constructor(server: Server) {
    this.server = server;
    this.setupServerRequestHandlers();
  }
}
```

**Concepts**:

- **State management**: Tracks both current transport and all transports
- **Session mapping**: `transports` object maps session IDs to transport instances
- **Constructor delegation**: Immediately sets up request handlers

#### SSE connection establishment (`handleGetRequest`)

The `handleGetRequest` method is responsible for establishing a new SSE connection when a client makes a GET request to the `/sse` endpoint.

```typescript
async handleGetRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  log.info(`GET ${req.originalUrl} (${req.ip})`);
  try {
    log.info("Connecting transport to server...");
    this.transport = new SSEServerTransport("/messages", res);
    TransportsCache.set(this.transport.sessionId, this.transport);

    res.on("close", () => {
      if (this.transport) {
        TransportsCache.delete(this.transport.sessionId);
      }
    });

    await this.server.connect(this.transport);
    log.success("Transport connected. Handling request...");
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
  }
}
```

**Concepts**:

- **Transport creation**: New `SSEServerTransport` for each GET request
- **Session management**: Autogenerated session ID stored in cache
- **Event handlers**: Cleanup on connection close
- **MCP connection**: `server.connect()` establishes protocol connection
- **Async flow**: Connection setup is asynchronous with error boundaries

#### Message processing (`handlePostRequest`)

The `handlePostRequest` method processes incoming POST requests to handle MCP messages sent by the client. It uses the session ID from the query parameters to find the correct transport instance.

```typescript
async handlePostRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  log.info(`POST ${req.originalUrl} (${req.ip}) - payload:`, req.body);

  const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
  const transport = TransportsCache.get(sessionId);
  if (transport) {
    await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res, req.body);
  } else {
    log.error("Transport not initialized. Cannot handle POST request.");
    res.status(400).json(/* error response */);
  }
}
```

**Concepts**:

- **Session lookup**: Uses `sessionId` query parameter to find transport
- **Session validation**: Validates SSE connection first.
- **Message delegation**: Transport handles actual message processing
- **Error responses**: Proper HTTP error codes for missing sessions

#### MCP Protocol Handler Setup (`setupServerRequestHandlers`)

The `setupServerRequestHandlers` method registers the following handlers for MCP protocol requests:

- A handler for `ListToolsRequestSchema` that returns the list of available TODO tools.
- A handler for `CallToolRequestSchema` that locates and executes the requested tool with the provided arguments.

This method uses [Zod schemas](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction) to define the expected request and response formats.

```typescript
private setupServerRequestHandlers() {
  this.server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async (_request) => {
    return {
      tools: TodoTools,
    };
  });
  
  this.server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
    const { name, arguments: args } = request.params;
    
    const tool = TodoTools.find((tool) => tool.name === name);
    if (!tool) {
      return this.createJSONErrorResponse(`Tool "${name}" not found.`);
    }
    
    const response = await tool.execute(args as any);
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: response }] };
  });
}
```

**Concepts**:

- **Schema-Based Routing**: Uses Zod schemas for type-safe request handling
- **Tool Discovery**: `ListToolsRequestSchema` returns static TodoTools array
- **Tool Execution**: `CallToolRequestSchema` finds and executes tools
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unknown tools
- **Response Format**: MCP-compliant response structure
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types ensure correct argument passing

### Business logic: `tools.ts`

The `tools.ts` file defines the actual functionality available to MCP clients:

- Tool metadata (name, description, schemas)
- Input validation schemas
- Tool execution logic
- Integration with database layer 

This MCP Server defines four TODO management tools:

- `add_todo`: Creates a new TODO item
- `complete_todo`: Marks a TODO item as completed
- `delete_todo`: Deletes a TODO item
- `list_todos`: Lists all TODO items
- `update_todo_text`: Updates the text of an existing TODO item

#### Tool Definition Pattern

The tools are defined as an array of objects, each representing a specific TODO operation. In the following code snippet, the `addTodo` tool is defined:

```typescript
{
  name: "addTodo",
  description: "Add a new TODO item to the list...",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      text: { type: "string" },
    },
    required: ["text"],
  },
  outputSchema: { type: "string" },
  async execute({ text }: { text: string }) {
    const info = await addTodo(text);
    return `Added TODO: ${text} (id: ${info.lastInsertRowid})`;
  },
}
```

Each tool definition has:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the tool
- `description`: Brief description of the tool's purpose
- `inputSchema`: Zod schema defining the expected input format
- `outputSchema`: Zod schema defining the expected output format
- `execute`: Function implementing the tool's logic

These tool definitions are imported in `server.ts` and exposed through the `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler.

**Concepts**:
- **Modular Tool Design**: Each tool is a self-contained object
- **JSON Schema Validation**: `inputSchema` defines expected parameters
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types match schema definitions
- **Async Execution**: All tool executions are asynchronous
- **Database Integration**: Calls imported database functions
- **Human-Readable Responses**: Returns formatted strings, not raw data

#### Tool Array Export

The tools are exported as a static array, making them easy to import and use in the server. Each tool is an object with its metadata and execution logic. This structure allows the MCP server to dynamically discover and execute tools based on client requests.

```typescript
export const TodoTools = [
  { /* addTodo */ },
  { /* listTodos */ },
  { /* completeTodo */ },
  { /* deleteTodo */ },
  { /* updateTodoText */ },
];
```

**Concepts**:

- **Static Registration**: Tools defined at module load time
- **Array Structure**: Simple array makes tools easy to iterate
- **Import/Export**: Clean separation from server logic

#### Tool execution error handling

Each tool's `execute` function handles errors smoothly and returns clear messages instead of throwing exceptions. This approach ensures the MCP server provides a seamless user experience.

Tools handle various error scenarios:

```typescript
async execute({ id }: { id: number }) {
  const info = await completeTodo(id);
  if (info.changes === 0) {
    return `TODO with id ${id} not found.`;
  }
  return `Marked TODO ${id} as completed.`;
}
```

**Concepts**:

- **Database Response Checking**: Uses `info.changes` to detect failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns descriptive error messages vs throwing
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Messages suitable for AI interpretation

### Data layer: `db.ts`

The `db.ts` file manages the SQLite database connection and handles CRUD operations for the TODO app. It uses the `better-sqlite3` library for synchronous database access.

#### Database initialization

The database initializes by connecting to SQLite and creating tables if they don't exist. The following code snippet shows the initialization process:

```typescript
const db = new Database(":memory:", {
  verbose: log.info,
});

try {
  db.pragma("journal_mode = WAL");
  db.prepare(
    `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${DB_NAME} (
     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     text TEXT NOT NULL,
     completed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
   )`
  ).run();
  log.success(`Database "${DB_NAME}" initialized.`);
} catch (error) {
  log.error(`Error initializing database "${DB_NAME}":`, { error });
}
```

**Concepts**:

- **In-Memory Database**: `:memory:` means data lost on restart (demo/testing only)
- **WAL Mode**: Write-Ahead Logging for better performance
- **Schema Definition**: Simple TODO table with autoincrement ID
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of initialization failures
- **Logging Integration**: Database operations are logged for debugging

#### CRUD operation patterns

The `db.ts` file provides four main CRUD operations for managing TODO items:

**Create operation**:

```typescript
export async function addTodo(text: string) {
  log.info(`Adding TODO: ${text}`);
  const stmt = db.prepare(`INSERT INTO todos (text, completed) VALUES (?, 0)`);
  return stmt.run(text);
}
```

**Read operation**:

```typescript
export async function listTodos() {
  log.info("Listing all TODOs...");
  const todos = db.prepare(`SELECT id, text, completed FROM todos`).all() as Array<{
    id: number;
    text: string;
    completed: number;
  }>;
  return todos.map(todo => ({
    ...todo,
    completed: Boolean(todo.completed),
  }));
}
```

**Update operation**:

```typescript
export async function completeTodo(id: number) {
  log.info(`Completing TODO with ID: ${id}`);
  const stmt = db.prepare(`UPDATE todos SET completed = 1 WHERE id = ?`);
  return stmt.run(id);
}
```

**Delete operation**:

```typescript
export async function deleteTodo(id: number) {
  log.info(`Deleting TODO with ID: ${id}`);
  const row = db.prepare(`SELECT text FROM todos WHERE id = ?`).get(id) as
    | { text: string }
    | undefined;
  if (!row) {
    log.error(`TODO with ID ${id} not found`);
    return null;
  }
  db.prepare(`DELETE FROM todos WHERE id = ?`).run(id);
  log.success(`TODO with ID ${id} deleted`);
  return row;
}
```

**Concepts**:

- **Prepared Statements**: Protection against SQL injection
- **Type Casting**: Explicit TypeScript types for query results
- **Data Transformation**: Converting SQLite integers to booleans
- **Atomic Operations**: Each function is a single database transaction
- **Return Value Consistency**: Functions return operation metadata
- **Defensive Programming**: Check-before-delete pattern

#### Schema Design

The database schema is defined in the `db.ts` file using a simple SQL statement. The `todos` table has three fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,  -- Unique identifier
  text TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- TODO description  
  completed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0   -- Boolean as integer
);
```

### Helper utilities: `helpers/` directory

The `helpers/` directory provides utility functions and classes for the server.

#### Structured logging for debugging and monitoring: `helpers/logs.ts`

The `helpers/logs.ts` file provides a structured logging utility for the MCP server. It uses the `debug` library for logging and `chalk` for color-coded output in the console.

```typescript
export const logger = (namespace: string) => {
  const dbg = debug('mcp:' + namespace);
  const log = (colorize: ChalkInstance, ...args: any[]) => {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const formattedArgs = [timestamp, ...args].map((arg) => {
      if (typeof arg === 'object') {
        return JSON.stringify(arg, null, 2);
      }
      return arg;
    });
    dbg(colorize(formattedArgs.join(' ')));
  };

  return {
    info(...args: any[]) { log(chalk.cyan, ...args); },
    success(...args: any[]) { log(chalk.green, ...args); },
    warn(...args: any[]) { log(chalk.yellow, ...args); },
    error(...args: any[]) { log(chalk.red, ...args); },
  };
};
```

#### Session management for SSE transports: `helpers/cache.ts`

The `helpers/cache.ts` file uses a `Map` to store SSE transports by session ID. This approach allows the server to quickly find and manage active connections.

```typescript
import type { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse";

export const TransportsCache = new Map<string, SSEServerTransport>();
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `TransportsCache` is a simple in-memory cache. In production, consider using a more robust solution like Redis or a database for session management.
