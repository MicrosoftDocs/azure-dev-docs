## Resources for Azure OpenAI Service

Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, image understanding, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Azure OpenAI SDK for .NET, or the web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

### Libraries and samples

## AI app templates

AI app templates provide you with well-maintained, easy to deploy reference implementations that provide a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

There are two categories of AI app templates, **building blocks** and **end-to-end solutions**. Building blocks are smaller-scale samples that focus on specific scenarios and tasks. End-to-end solutions are comprehensive reference samples including documention, source code, and deployment to allow you to take and extend for your own purposes.

To review a list of key templates available for each programming language, see [AI app templates](/azure/developer/ai/intelligent-app-templates). To browse all available templates, see the AI app templates on the [Azure Developer CLI gallery](https://aka.ms/ai-apps).
