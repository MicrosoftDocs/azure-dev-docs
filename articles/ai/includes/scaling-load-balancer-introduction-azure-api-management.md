Learn how to add enterprise-grade load balancing to your application to extend the chat app beyond the Azure OpenAI Service token and model quota limits. This approach uses Azure API Management to intelligently direct traffic between three Azure OpenAI resources.

This article requires you to deploy two separate samples:

* Chat app:
  * Wait to deploy the chat app until after the load balancer sample is deployed.
  * If you already deployed the chat app once, change the environment variable to support a custom endpoint for the load balancer and redeploy it again.
* Load balancer with Azure API Management.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses one or more [AI app templates](../intelligent-app-templates.md) as the basis for the examples and guidance in the article. AI app templates provide you with well-maintained reference implementations that are easy to deploy. They help to ensure a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

## Architecture for load balancing Azure OpenAI with Azure API Management

Because the Azure OpenAI resource has specific token and model quota limits, a chat app that uses a single Azure OpenAI resource is prone to have conversation failures because of those limits.

To use the chat app without hitting those limits, use a load-balanced solution with API Management. This solution seamlessly exposes a single endpoint from API Management to your chat app server.

The API Management resource, as an API layer, sits in front of a set of Azure OpenAI resources. The API layer applies to two scenarios: normal and throttled. During a *normal scenario* where token and model quota is available, the Azure OpenAI resource returns a 200 back through the API layer and backend app server.

When a resource is *throttled* because of quota limits, the API layer can retry a different Azure OpenAI resource immediately to fulfill the original chat app request.
