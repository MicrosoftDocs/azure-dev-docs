# Get started with multimodal vision chat apps using Azure OpenAI

This article shows you how to use Azure OpenAI multimodal models to generate responses to user messages and uploaded images in a chat app. This chat app sample also includes all the infrastructure and configuration needed to provision Azure OpenAI resources and deploy the app to Azure Container Apps using the Azure Developer CLI.

By following the instructions in this article, you will:

- Deploy an Azure Container chat app that uses managed identity for authentication.
- Upload images to be used as part of the chat stream.
- Chat with an Azure OpenAI multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) using the OpenAI library.

Once you complete this article, you can start modifying the new project with your custom code.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses one or more [AI app templates](./intelligent-app-templates.md) as the basis for the examples and guidance in the article. AI app templates provide you with well-maintained, easy to deploy reference implementations that help to ensure a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

## Architectural overview

A simple architecture of the chat app is shown in the following diagram:
:::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-vision/simple-architecture-diagram.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-securing-your-ai-app/simple-architecture-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing architecture from client to backend app.":::

The chat app is running as an Azure Container App. The app uses managed identity via Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate with Azure OpenAI, instead of an API key. The chat app uses Azure OpenAI to generate responses to user messages.

The application architecture relies on the following services and components:

- [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/) represents the AI provider that we send the user's queries to.
- [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/) is the container environment where the application is hosted.
- [Managed Identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/) helps us ensure best-in-class security and eliminates the requirement for you as a developer to securely manage a secret.
- [Bicep files](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/) for provisioning Azure resources, including Azure OpenAI, Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Registry, Azure Log Analytics, and role-based access control (RBAC) roles.
- [Microsoft AI Chat Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-chat-protocol/) provides standardized API contracts across AI solutions and languages. The chat app conforms to the Microsoft AI Chat Protocol.
- A Python [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com) that uses the [`openai`](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) package to generate responses to user messages with uploaded image files.
- A basic HTML/JavaScript frontend that streams responses from the backend using [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) over a [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream).

## Cost

In an attempt to keep pricing as low as possible in this sample, most resources use a basic or consumption pricing tier. Alter your tier level as needed based on your intended usage. To stop incurring charges, delete the resources when you're done with the article.

## Deploy and run

The sample repository contains all the code and configuration files for the chat app Azure deployment. The following steps walk you through the sample chat app Azure deployment process.

### Deploy chat app to Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure resources created in this section incur immediate costs. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed.

1. Run the following Azure Developer CLI command for Azure resource provisioning and source code deployment:

    ```azdeveloper
    azd up
    ```

1. Use the following table to answer the prompts:

    |Prompt|Answer|
    |--|--|
    |Environment name|Keep it short and lowercase. Add your name or alias. For example, `chat-vision`. It's used as part of the resource group name.|
    |Subscription|Select the subscription to create the resources in. |
    |Location (for hosting)|Select a location near you from the list.|
    |Location for the Azure OpenAI model|Select a location near you from the list. If the same location is available as your first location, select that.|

1. Wait until app is deployed. Deployment usually takes between 5 and 10 minutes to complete.

### Use chat app to ask questions to the Large Language Model

1. The terminal displays a URL after successful application deployment.

1. Select that URL labeled `Deploying service web` to open the chat application in a browser.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-vision/screenshot-chat-image.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-vision/screenshot-chat-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat app in browser with a question about an uploaded image in chat along with the response and the chat text box to enter a question.":::

1. In the browser, upload an image by clicking on **Choose File** and selecting an image.
1. Ask a question about the uploaded image such as "What is the image about?".

1. The answer comes from Azure OpenAI and the result is displayed.

## Exploring the sample code

 While OpenAI and Azure OpenAI Service rely on a [common Python client library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), small code changes are needed when using Azure OpenAI endpoints. This sample uses an Azure OpenAI multimodal model to generate responses to user messages and uploaded images.

### Base64 Encoding the uploaded image in the frontend

The uploaded image needs to be Base64 encoded so that it can be used directly as a Data URI as part of the message.

In the sample, the following frontend code snippet in the `script`tag of the `src/quartapp/templates/index.html` file handles that functionality. The `toBase64` arrow function uses the `readAsDataURL` method of the`FileReader` to asynchronously read in the uploaded image file as a base64 encoded string.  

```javascript
    const toBase64 = file => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
        reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result);
        reader.onerror = reject;
    });
```

The `toBase64` function is called by a listener on the form's `submit` event. When the `submit` event fires, the listener checks for an image file, and handles it if present by Base64 encoding the image using the `toBase64` function. The new image data url, `fileData`, is then appended to the message.

```javascript
    form.addEventListener("submit", async function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();

        const file = document.getElementById("file").files[0];
        const fileData = file ? await toBase64(file) : null;

        const message = messageInput.value;

        const userTemplateClone = userTemplate.content.cloneNode(true);
        userTemplateClone.querySelector(".message-content").innerText = message;
        if (file) {
            const img = document.createElement("img");
            img.src = fileData;
            userTemplateClone.querySelector(".message-file").appendChild(img);
        }
        targetContainer.appendChild(userTemplateClone);
```

### Handling the image with the backend

In the `src\quartapp\chat.py` file, the backend code for image handling starts after configuring keyless authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to use keyless connections for authentication and authorization to Azure OpenAI, check out the [Get started with the Azure OpenAI security building block](get-started-securing-your-ai-app.md) Microsoft Learn article.

#### Chat handler function

The `chat_handler()` function waits for incoming request JSON data from the `chat/stream` endpoint then processes it. The messages are then extracted from the JSON data. Finally, the base64 encoded image is retrieved from the JSON data.

```python
@bp.post("/chat/stream")
async def chat_handler():
    request_json = await request.get_json()
    request_messages = request_json["messages"]
    # get the base64 encoded image from the request
    image = request_json["context"]["file"]
```

#### Response stream using the OpenAI Client and model

The `response_stream` inside the `chat_handler` function handles the chat completion call in the route. The following code snippet begins by preprocessing the user content messages. If an image is present, the image URL is appended to the user content, with the 

```python
    @stream_with_context
    async def response_stream():
        # This sends all messages, so API request may exceed token limits
        all_messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        ] + request_messages[0:-1]
        all_messages = request_messages[0:-1]
        if image:
            user_content = []
            user_content.append({"text": request_messages[-1]["content"], "type": "text"})
            user_content.append({"image_url": {"url": image, "detail": "auto"}, "type": "image_url"})
            all_messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_content})
        else:
            all_messages.append(request_messages[-1])
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the image `detail` parameter and related settings, check out the [Detail parameter settings in image processing: Low, High, Auto](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/gpt-with-vision?tabs=python#detail-parameter-settings-in-image-processing-low-high-auto) section in the "Use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision" Microsoft Learn article.

Next, `bp.openai_client.chat.completions` gets chat completions via an Azure OpenAI API call and streams the response.

```python
        chat_coroutine = bp.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            # Azure OpenAI takes the deployment name as the model name
            model=bp.model_name,
            messages=all_messages,
            stream=True,
            temperature=request_json.get("temperature", 0.5),
        )
```

Finally, the response is streamed back to the client, with error handling for any exceptions.

```python
        try:
            async for event in await chat_coroutine:
                event_dict = event.model_dump()
                if event_dict["choices"]:
                    yield json.dumps(event_dict["choices"][0], ensure_ascii=False) + "\n"
        except Exception as e:
            current_app.logger.error(e)
            yield json.dumps({"error": str(e)}, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n"

    return Response(response_stream())

```
