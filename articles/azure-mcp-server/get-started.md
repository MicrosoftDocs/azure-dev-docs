# Get started with the Azure MCP Server

The [Azure MCP Server](overview.md) enables AI-powered development tools to interact with Azure cloud services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a unified way to manage Azure resources, deploy applications, and query cloud services directly from your development environment.

Connect to Azure MCP Server using various tools, languages, and frameworks. Use it to manage Azure resources through natural language conversations, build automation scripts, or integrate Azure operations into your applications.

Explore and contribute to the [Azure MCP Server on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/tree/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server).

## Install with a package manager

If you prefer to install Azure MCP Server directly using a package manager instead of through an IDE, you can install it using npm, pip, or other package managers. For detailed installation instructions, see [Install with a package manager](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/README.md#package-manager).

## Connect using code editors and tools

Azure MCP Server works with AI-powered code editors and tools that support the Model Context Protocol. Learn how to get started:
