## Install the Azure MCP Server

Select one of the following options to install the Azure MCP Server in Visual Studio Code:

## [Global install](#tab/one-click)

1. To install the Azure MCP Server for Visual Studio Code in your user settings, select the following link:

    [![Install with NPX in Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Azure_MCP_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=Azure%20MCP%20Server&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40azure%2Fmcp%40latest%22%2C%22server%22%2C%22start%22%5D%7D)

    A list of installation options opens inside Visual Studio Code. Select **Install Server** to add the server configuration to your user settings.

1. Open GitHub Copilot and select Agent Mode. To learn more about Agent Mode, visit the [Visual Studio Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode).
1. Refresh the tools list to see Azure MCP Server as an available option:

## [Directory install](#tab/manual)

You can also manually install Azure MCP Server for a specific directory:

1. Open an empty directory or an existing project directory in Visual Studio Code.
1. At the root of the folder, create a `.vscode` folder if there isn't one already.
1. Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a new file named `mcp.json` add the following JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "Azure MCP Server": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@azure/mcp@latest",
            "server",
            "start"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Save your changes to `mcp.json`.
1. Open GitHub Copilot and select Agent Mode.
1. Select the tools icon to view the available tools. Search for *Azure MCP Server* to filter the results.

## Use prompts to test the Azure MCP Server

1. Open GitHub Copilot and select Agent Mode.
1. Enter a prompt that causes the agent to use Azure MCP Server tools, such as *List my Azure resource groups*.
1. In order to authenticate Azure MCP Server, Copilot prompts you to sign-in to Azure using the browser.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Copilot won't prompt you to sign-in to Azure if you're already authenticated via other local tooling such as the Azure CLI.

1. Copilot requests permission to run the necessary Azure MCP Server operation for your prompt. Select **Continue** or use the arrow to select a more specific behavior:
    - **Current session** always runs the operation in the current GitHub Copilot Agent Mode session.
    - **Current workspace** always runs the command for current Visual Studio Code workspace.
    - **Always allow** sets the operation to always run for any GitHub Copilot Agent Mode session or any Visual Studio Code workspace.

    The output for the previous prompt should resemble the following text:

    ```output
    The following resource groups are available for your subscription:

    1. **DefaultResourceGroup-EUS** (Location: `eastus`)
    2. **rg-testing** (Location: `centralus`)
    3. **rg-azd** (Location: `eastus2`)
    4. **msdocs-sample** (Location: `southcentralus`)
    14. **ai-testing** (Location: `eastus2`)
    
    Let me know if you need further details or actions related to any of these resource groups!
    ```

1. Explore and test the Azure MCP operations using other relevant prompts, such as:

    ```
    List all of the storage accounts in my subscription
    Get the available tables in my storage accounts
    ```
