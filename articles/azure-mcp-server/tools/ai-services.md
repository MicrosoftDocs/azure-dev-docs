# Azure AI Services tools for the Azure MCP Server

Use the Azure MCP Server to manage Azure AI Service resources with natural language prompts. You don't need to remember specific command syntax.

## Speech-to-Text: Recognize

<!-- `azmcp speech stt recognize` -->


Recognize speech from an audio file using [Azure AI Services Speech](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-to-text). This command takes an audio file and converts it to text using advanced speech recognition capabilities. Supported audio formats include WAV, MP3, OPUS/OGG, FLAC, ALAW, MULAW, MP4, M4A, and AAC. Compressed formats require GStreamer to be installed on the system.

Example prompts include:

- **Basic conversion**: "Convert this audio file to text using Azure Speech Services"
- **With language detection**: "Recognize speech from my audio file with language detection"
- **With profanity filtering**: "Transcribe speech from audio file with profanity filtering"
- **Specify endpoint**: "Convert speech to text from audio file using my cognitive services endpoint"
- **Spanish language**: "Transcribe the audio file in Spanish language"
- **Detailed output**: "Convert speech to text with detailed output format from audio file"
- **With phrase hints**: "Recognize speech with phrase hints for better accuracy"
- **Multiple phrase hints**: "Transcribe audio using multiple phrase hints: 'Azure', 'cognitive services', 'machine learning'"
- **Comma-separated hints**: "Convert speech to text with comma-separated phrase hints: 'Azure, cognitive services, API'"
- **Raw profanity output**: "Transcribe audio with raw profanity output from file"
