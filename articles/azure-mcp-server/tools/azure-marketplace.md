# Marketplace tools for the Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server lets you manage Azure resources, including Azure Marketplace products, by using natural language prompts. With this capability, you can quickly discover and retrieve information about marketplace offerings without needing to remember complex syntax.

[Azure Marketplace](/azure/marketplace/) is an online store for solutions that are built on or built for Azure. It's designed for IT professionals and developers. The marketplace offers a catalog of applications, services, and solutions from Microsoft and partners that help you accelerate your cloud adoption and digital transformation.
