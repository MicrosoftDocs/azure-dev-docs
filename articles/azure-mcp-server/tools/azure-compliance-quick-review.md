# Azure Quick Review CLI tools for the Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server allows you to execute Azure Quick Review (azqr) commands using natural language prompts. This enables you to generate compliance and security reports for your Azure resources to identify non-compliant configurations and areas for improvement without needing to remember specific command syntax.

[Azure Quick Review CLI (azqr)](https://github.com/Azure/azqr) is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool that specializes in analyzing Azure resources to ensure compliance with Azure's best practices and recommendations. Its main objective is to offer users a comprehensive overview of their Azure resources, allowing them to easily identify any non-compliant configurations or areas for improvement.
