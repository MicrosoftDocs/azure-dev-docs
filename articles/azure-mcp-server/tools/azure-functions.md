# Azure Functions tools for the Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server allows you to manage Azure resources, including Functions, using natural language prompts. This allows you to quickly list Azure Functions without remembering complex syntax.

[Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/)  is a serverless solution that allows you to build robust apps while using less code, and with less infrastructure and lower costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, you can use the cloud infrastructure to provide all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

## List

Lists all Azure Function Apps in a subscription.


Example prompts include:

- **List function apps**: "List all Azure Function Apps in my subscription."
- **Show function apps**: "What function apps do I have?"
- **Find function apps in a group**: "Show me all function apps in resource group 'devops-resources'."
- **Filter by resource group**: "List function apps in the resource group 'production-resources'."
- **Query function apps**: "Can you list all my Azure Function Apps?"
- **Check function apps**: "Function apps in subscription abc123."
