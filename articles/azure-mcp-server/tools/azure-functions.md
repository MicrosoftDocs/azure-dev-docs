# Azure Functions tools for the Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server allows you to manage Azure resources, including function apps, using natural language prompts. This allows you to quickly list your apps without remembering complex syntax.

[Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/) is a serverless compute service that enables you to integrate code execution into your Azure services with less code and using popular development tools. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, you can spend time developing your applications.

## List

Lists all function apps in an Azure subscription.

Example prompts include:

- **List function apps**: "List all function apps in my subscription."
- **Show function apps**: "What function apps do I have?"
- **Find function apps in a group**: "Show me all function apps in resource group 'devops-resources'."
- **Filter by resource group**: "List function apps in the resource group 'production-resources'."
- **Query function apps**: "Can you list all my function apps?"
- **Check function apps**: "Function apps in subscription abc123."
