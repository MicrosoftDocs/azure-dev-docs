# Azure Managed Grafana tools for the Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server allows you to manage Azure resources, including Azure Managed Grafana workspaces using natural language prompts. This enables you to quickly manage your monitoring and visualization resources without remembering complex syntax.

[Azure Managed Grafana](/azure/managed-grafana/) is a fully managed service that offers Grafana dashboards as a service. It enables you to analyze metrics, logs, and traces without having to worry about setting up, maintaining, or scaling the Grafana infrastructure.

## List Grafana workspaces

<!-- azmcp grafana list -->

- **Show all workspaces**: Show me all Grafana workspaces in my subscription
- **List monitoring resources**: What Grafana workspaces do I have available?
- **Find visualization dashboards**: List all my Azure Managed Grafana resources
- **Check workspace status**: Are there any Grafana workspaces in my dev subscription?
