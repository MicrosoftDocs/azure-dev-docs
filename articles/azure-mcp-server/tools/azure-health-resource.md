# Azure Health Resources tools for the Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server enables you to monitor resource health and availability by using natural language prompts. With this capability, you can quickly check the status of your Azure resources without needing to remember complex command syntax.

[Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/) helps you stay informed and get support when Azure services are having issues that affect you now, or could cause issues in the future. Azure Service Health includes three main components - Azure Status, Service Health, and Resource Health.

## Availability status: Get

<!-- `azmcp resourcehealth availability-status get` -->

Get the current availability status of an Azure resource to diagnose health issues. Provides detailed information about resource availability state, potential issues, and timestamps. 

Example prompts include:

- **Get resource health**: "Get the availability status for resource '/subscriptions/123/resourceGroups/mygroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myvm'."
- **Check VM health**: "Show me the health status of my virtual machine 'myvm' in resource group 'mygroup'."
- **Resource status**: "What is the current status of resource '/subscriptions/abc/resourceGroups/infra/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/sql-prod'?"
- **Diagnose resource issue**: "Check the availability status for my storage account 'mystorageaccount'."
- **View health details**: "Show health details for resource '/subscriptions/xyz/resourceGroups/web/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/webapp-prod'."

| Parameter |  Required or optional | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Resource ID** | Required | The Azure resource ID to get health status for (for example, `/subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm}`). |


## Availability status: List

<!-- `azmcp resourcehealth availability-status list` -->

List availability statuses for all resources in a subscription or resource group. Provides health status information for multiple Azure resources at once, including availability state, summaries, and timestamps. This information is useful for getting an overview of resource health across your infrastructure. You can filter results by resource group to narrow the scope.

Example prompts include:

- **List all resource health**: "List the availability statuses for all resources in my subscription."
- **Check resource group health**: "Show me the health status of all resources in resource group 'mygroup'."
- **Filter by resource type**: "Get the availability status for all virtual machines in my subscription."
- **Summarize resource health**: "What is the overall health status of resources in resource group 'mygroup'?"



## Service health events: List events

<!-- `azmcp resourcehealth service-health-events list` -->

List Azure service health events for a subscription to identify ongoing or past service issues. Provides comprehensive information about service incidents, planned maintenance, advisories, and security events. Supports filtering by event type, status, tracking ID, and custom OData filters.
Equivalent to Azure Service Health API for service events.

Example prompts include: 

- **View all events**: "List all service health events in my subscription"
- **Filter by subscription**: "Show me Azure service health events for subscription 'dev-subscription'"
- **Time-based filtering**: "What service issues have occurred in the last 30 days?"
- **Active events only**: "List active service health events in my subscription"
- **Planned maintenance**: "Show me planned maintenance events for my Azure services"

| Parameter |  Required or optional | Description |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Event Type** |  Optional | Filter by event type (ServiceIssue, PlannedMaintenance, HealthAdvisory, Security). If not specified, all event types are included. |
| **Status** |  Optional | Filter by status (Active, Resolved). If not specified, all statuses are included. |
| **Tracking ID** |  Optional | Filter by tracking ID to get a specific service health event. |
| **Filter** |  Optional | Additional OData filter expression to apply to the service health events query. |
| **Query Start Time** |  Optional | Start time for the query in ISO 8601 format (for example, 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z). Events from this time onwards will be included. |
| **Query End Time** |  Optional | End time for the query in ISO 8601 format (for example, 2024-01-31T23:59:59Z). Events up to this time will be included. |
