# Copilot Instructions

This file provides central guidance for Copilot in this repository.

## Referenced Instruction Files

- [.github/instructions/rust-instructions.md](.github/instructions/rust-instructions.md)

## Disclosure

For any Markdown files generated by AI, always disclose that they were created with the assistance of AI. Add the following frontmatter key/value pair:

```markdown
ai-usage: ai-generated
```

## Writing Style

Follow [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) with these specifics:

### Voice and Tone

- Active voice, second person addressing reader directly.
- Conversational tone with contractions.
- Present tense for instructions/descriptions.
- Imperative mood for instructions ("Call the method" not "You should call the method").
- Use "might" instead of "may" for possibility.
- Use "can" instead of "may" for permissible actions.
- Avoid "we"/"our" referring to documentation authors or product teams.

### Structure and Format

- Sentence case headings (no gerunds in titles).
- Be concise, break up long sentences.
- Oxford comma in lists.
- Use bullets for unordered lists.
- Number all ordered list items as "1." (not sequential numbering like "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.)
- Ordered and unordered lists should use complete sentences with proper punctuation, ending with a period if it's more than three words.
- Avoid "etc." or "and so on" - provide complete lists or use "for example".
- Use "for example" instead of "e.g.".
- Use "that is" instead of "i.e.".
- No consecutive headings without content between them.

### Formatting Conventions

- **Bold** for UI elements.
- `Code style` for file names, folders, custom types, non-localizable text.
- Raw URLs in angle brackets.
- Use relative links for files in this repo.
- Remove `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us` from learn.microsoft.com links.

## File Naming

New Markdown files: lowercase with hyphens, omit filler words (the, a, etc.).

## General Guidance

- Always check for and follow the latest instructions in `.github/instructions/`.
- Do not change the meaning of the original content unless explicitly instructed.

_Note: Add new instruction files to `.github/instructions/` and reference them under Referenced Instruction Files as needed._
