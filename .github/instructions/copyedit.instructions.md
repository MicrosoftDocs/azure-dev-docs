# Copyediting Instructions for Markdown Files

## General Guidelines
- Microsoft Style Guide is the authoritative source for all guidelines. If any instruction here conflicts, follow the Microsoft Style Guide.
- Be warm, relaxed, and conversational—write like you speak.
- Use contractions (it’s, you’re, we’re, let’s) for a friendly, informal tone.
- Use short, simple words and sentences; prune every excess word.
- Get to the point fast—lead with the most important information.
- Avoid jargon, acronyms, and overly technical language unless necessary.
- Always use active voice and present tense when possible.
- Start statements with verbs and avoid “you can,” “there is/are,” or “there were.”
- Use parallel sentence structure for headings and lists.
- Focus on what matters to customers; use words they’d use.
- Write for an average reading level to maximize accessibility.
- Make sure verb tenses match throughout the document.
- Do not change the meaning of the original content.
- Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
- Ensure all headings are properly formatted and follow a logical hierarchy.
- Break up long paragraphs for readability.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for complex or multi-step information.

## Formatting and Structure
- Use sentence-style capitalization for headings and list items (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
- Don’t use periods, colons, exclamation points, or question marks at the end of headings, titles, or short list items.
- Use the Oxford (serial) comma in lists of three or more items.
- Use only one space after periods, question marks, and colons; no spaces around dashes.
- For lists:
  - Use bulleted lists for unordered items, numbered lists for steps or priorities.
  - Introduce lists with a heading, complete sentence, or fragment ending with a colon.
  - Begin each list item with a capital letter.
  - Don’t use semicolons, commas, or conjunctions at the end of list items.
  - Don’t use a period at the end of list items unless they’re complete sentences.
  - Keep lists between two and seven items; keep items short and consistent in structure.
- Use proper Markdown syntax for headings, lists, links, images, and code blocks.
- Keep the raw markdown format; do not convert to other formats.
- Ensure code blocks are properly fenced and specify the language when appropriate.
- Check that all links are valid and descriptive.
- Use bold or italics for emphasis sparingly and consistently.
- Ensure tables are formatted for readability and accessibility.

## Headings
- Make headings specific, pithy, and interesting.
- Use heading levels logically; avoid two headings in a row without text in between.
- Don’t use ampersands (&), plus signs (+), or hyphens in headings unless necessary.
- Use vertical spacing to make headings stand out; don’t add extra line breaks.

## Content
- Verify that all information is accurate and up to date.
- Remove redundant or duplicate content.
- Ensure that instructions and steps are clear and actionable.
- Add clarifying notes or examples where helpful.
- Ensure that all images and diagrams have descriptive alt text.

## Consistency and Accuracy
- Use consistent terminology and style throughout.
- Follow any project-specific style guides or conventions.
- Ensure consistent use of capitalization, especially in headings and technical terms.
- Do not change the meaning of the original content.

## Final Review
- Read through the entire document to ensure flow and coherence.
- Check for any unresolved comments or placeholders.
- Save and back up the edited file.
