# azure.yaml schema documentation conventions

This instruction file defines the structure and conventions for the `azd-schema.md` reference page. Follow these rules when updating the page to ensure incremental, non-destructive edits.

## Source of truth

The JSON schema published at <https://aka.ms/azure.yaml.json> (source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-dev/main/schemas/v1.0/azure.yaml.json`) is the single source of truth. All property names, types, descriptions, enum values, and defaults in the documentation must match the schema.

A local copy is kept at `articles/azure-developer-cli/source-schema.json` to serve as a baseline for diffing against newer versions.

## Update workflow

1. Fetch the latest schema from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-dev/main/schemas/v1.0/azure.yaml.json`.
1. Diff it against the local `articles/azure-developer-cli/source-schema.json` to identify changes (added properties, removed enum values, updated descriptions, new definitions).
1. Apply only the corresponding targeted edits to `azd-schema.md`. Don't regenerate the entire file.
1. Replace `source-schema.json` with the fetched version so it stays current for future diffs.
1. Preserve all existing structure, heading hierarchy, and section ordering.

## Page structure (do not reorder)

1. Frontmatter (YAML)
1. H1: title
1. Intro paragraph with template link and schema link
1. `## Sample` — introductory YAML examples
1. `## Top-level properties` — summary table with anchor links
1. One `## {propertyName}` section per top-level property, in the order they appear in the schema's `properties` object: `name`, `resourceGroup`, `metadata`, `infra`, `services`, `resources`, `pipeline`, `hooks`, `requiredVersions`, `state`, `platform`, `workflows`, `cloud`
1. Within `## services`, include `#### docker` and `#### k8s` subsections for the shared Docker and AKS definitions (from the schema's `definitions` section). These are service-level properties nested under `### Service properties`, not top-level.
1. Include footer and `## Next steps`

## Section template

Every property section follows this exact pattern:

````markdown
## `{propertyName}`

_(type, required/optional)_ {Description from schema, verbatim or minimally adapted for grammar.}

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{childProp}` | Y/N/Conditional | {type} | {Description}. Default: `{value}`. Allowed values: `a`, `b`. |

> [!NOTE]
> {Conditional constraint note, if applicable.}

### {Sub-section for nested objects}

{Same table pattern.}

### {propertyName} samples (if examples exist)

```yaml
{YAML example}
```
````

## Table conventions

- Column order: Property, Required, Type, Description.
- Use `Y`, `N`, or `Conditional` in the Required column.
- Include `Default: {value}.` at the end of the description when a default exists.
- Include `Allowed values: {comma-separated list}.` at the end of the description when an enum exists.
- Use `array of strings` for `{ "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }`.
- Use `object` for complex nested types, with a "See [link](#anchor)" reference.
- Don't add a Type column entry for `$ref` — resolve the reference and document inline or link to the definition section.

## Description conventions

- Use schema `description` text verbatim when possible.
- Adapt only for grammar (for example, sentence fragments become complete sentences).
- Replace "e.g." with "for example" and "i.e." with "that is".
- Don't paraphrase or rewrite descriptions that are already clear.
- Use "can't" not "cannot", contractions per Microsoft style guide.

## Conditional schema (allOf/if/then) conventions

- Document constraints as `> [!NOTE]` blocks below the relevant table.
- For host-type applicability, use the "Host types" matrix table.
- For resource-type applicability, use the "Resource types" table with a link to sub-sections.
- State constraints in plain language: "When `host` is `containerapp`, you must provide either `image` or `project`, but not both."

## YAML examples

- Include one YAML code block per section, showing the property in context.
- Use realistic but generic values (not placeholder `xxx`).
- Keep examples minimal — show the property being documented plus necessary parent structure.
- Use `yaml` as the code fence language.

## What NOT to change during updates

- Frontmatter fields other than `ms.date` (update the date on each edit).
- The intro paragraph and Sample section (unless the schema `title` or `description` changes).
- Section ordering.
- The `## Next steps` section.
- Cross-reference links to other docs (for example, `azd-extensibility.md`).
