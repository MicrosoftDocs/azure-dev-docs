# Deploy a static website to Azure from Visual Studio Code

In this tutorial, you create and deploy a static website to Azure using [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage). A static website is composed of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static files such as images or fonts. A static site is typically a single-page application (or [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) written with Angular, React or Vue. However you design the app, you host and serve these files directly from _storage_ rather than using a web server. Hosting in storage is simpler and less expensive than maintaining a web server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have your own server code, such as a Node.js/Express app, follow the [App Service tutorial](tutorial-vscode-azure-app-service-node-01.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription](#azure-subscription).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The [Azure Storage extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage).
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download), the Node.js package manager. (This requirement is used only to generate a sample project. You don't need to install Node.js if you already have app code.)
